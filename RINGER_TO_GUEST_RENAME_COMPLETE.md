## 🚀 What You Get

### Before
- ❌ Confusing "ringer" terminology
- ❌ Not immediately clear what a "ringer" is
- ❌ Requires explanation to new users

### After
- ✅ Clear "Guest" terminology
- ✅ Immediately understandable
- ✅ Self-explanatory in context
- ✅ Professional and user-friendly

---

## 🔧 Technical Pattern Used

This follows the standard **Display Transformation Pattern**:

```
Database → API Transform → UI Display
is_ringer → isRinger → "Guest"
```

**Examples of this pattern elsewhere in your app:**
- `is_admin` → `isAdmin` → "Administrator"
- `is_retired` → `isRetired` → "Retired"
- `created_at` → `createdAt` → "Date Created"

This is **completely normal** and **industry standard**.

## 📝 Notes

1. **No migration needed**: Database stays as-is
2. **No API changes**: External consumers unaffected
3. **No type updates**: TypeScript types remain consistent
4. **Backward compatible**: 100% compatible with existing code

5. **Commit message suggestion**:
   ```
   refactor(ui): rename "ringer" to "Guest" in user-facing text
   
   - Update all UI labels and tooltips from "ringer" to "Guest"
   - Update documentation with clearer terminology
   - Keep all internal code unchanged (is_ringer, isRinger)
   - No breaking changes, no migration required
   ```

## 🎉 Result

**Effort**: ~6 hours total  
**Risk**: Low  
**User Impact**: High
