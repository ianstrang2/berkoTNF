# BerkoTNF Project Rules

## File Organization
- Organize code by feature, not by type
- Use App Router (Next.js 13+) - pages in `/app`, components in `/components`
- Backend assets: Supabase Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`, SQL scripts in `sql/`

## Naming Conventions
- Components: `{ComponentName}.component.tsx`
- Pages: `{PageName}.page.tsx`  
- Layouts: `{LayoutName}.layout.tsx`
- Hooks: `use{HookName}.hook.ts`
- Utilities: `{utilName}.util.ts`
- Services: `{ServiceName}.service.ts`

## Import Conventions
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- Import UI components individually, avoid barrel exports
- Example: `import Button from '@/components/ui-kit/Button.component';`

## React Conventions
- Add `'use client'` directive for client-side components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Prefer explicit prop types over `React.FC<Props>`

## Database Access Patterns

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Multi-Tenancy Security (MANDATORY)

**RLS DOES NOT ENFORCE** - Explicit tenant filtering is your ONLY security.

**Every tenant-scoped query MUST include `where: { tenant_id }`**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Secure
const data = await prisma.players.findMany({
  where: { tenant_id: tenantId }  // ← MANDATORY
});

// ❌ SECURITY VULNERABILITY - Missing tenant filter
const data = await prisma.players.findMany({});
```

### API Routes - Use Prisma for Fresh Data
- **ALWAYS use Prisma** for API routes that read application data
- **ALWAYS include tenant_id filter** on tenant-scoped tables
- **Supabase client causes stale data issues** due to connection pooling/caching
- Use `import { prisma } from '@/lib/prisma';`
- Use `getTenantFromRequest(request)` to get tenant context

**✅ Correct Pattern:**
```typescript
const tenantId = await getTenantFromRequest(request);
const playerData = await prisma.aggregated_player_power_ratings.findUnique({
  where: { 
    player_id: playerId,
    tenant_id: tenantId  // ⚠️ MANDATORY
  },
  select: { trend_rating: true, trend_goal_threat: true } as any
});
```

**❌ SECURITY VULNERABILITY:**
```typescript
// Missing tenant_id - ALLOWS CROSS-TENANT DATA LEAK  
const playerData = await prisma.aggregated_player_power_ratings.findUnique({
  where: { player_id: playerId }  // ❌ NO tenant_id!
});
```

### Edge Functions - Use Supabase Client
- **Supabase Edge Functions** in `supabase/functions/` should use Supabase client
- **SQL scripts** in `sql/` use direct PostgreSQL

### Type Safety
- Use `as any` for Prisma selects with newer schema fields not yet in generated types
- Follow existing working API patterns (see `playerprofile/route.ts`)

## App Router Flow
- Pages in `/app` should be minimal - just import and render components
- Business logic and UI should live in `/components`
- Example pattern:
```typescript
// /app/some-route/page.tsx
import { SomeComponent } from '@/components/feature';
export default function SomePage() {
  return <SomeComponent />;
}
```

## Component Template
```typescript
'use client';
import React from 'react';

interface ComponentProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  // other props
}

const ComponentName = ({ children }: ComponentProps) => {
  return (
    // component JSX
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

## Key Feature Directories
- `/components/dashboard/` - Dashboard widgets (PersonalBests, Milestones, MatchReport)
- `/components/records/` - All-time records (LeaderboardStats, Legends, Feats)  
- `/components/tables/` - Season standings (CurrentHalfSeason, OverallSeasonPerformance)

- `/components/ui-kit/` - Reusable UI components

### Canonical Player Data Types

To ensure consistency and type safety, all player-related data across the application must conform to the canonical types defined in `src/types/player.types.ts`.

-   **Primary Type:** `PlayerProfile` is the base interface for any player.
-   **Contextual Types:** Use extended types like `PlayerInPool` or `PlayerWithStats` for specific use cases (e.g., match management, statistics).
-   **API Boundary:** The API layer is responsible for transforming raw database results (snake_case) into these camelCase canonical types using the helpers in `src/lib/transform/player.transform.ts`. Frontend components should expect to receive data in this clean format.
-   **Deprecation:** Avoid using or creating any local, one-off player types (e.g., `MatchPlayer`, `PlayerWithNameAndId`). Always import from the canonical types file.
-   **ID Convention:** The canonical frontend type `PlayerProfile` uses `id: string` for consistency with component keys and other browser APIs. The database uses `player_id: number`. The transformation helpers in `src/lib/transform/player.transform.ts` are responsible for converting the numeric ID from the database to a string. Conversely, API routes must parse string IDs from the frontend back into numbers before performing database operations.

# General Code Generation Rules

## SQL File Handling

### Schema Migrations
- **NEVER** create migration .sql files
- **ALWAYS** provide migration SQL in markdown blocks for manual execution in Supabase SQL editor
- **NEVER** use tools to execute exploratory SQL queries

### Business Logic SQL Functions
- **DO** create SQL function files in `/sql/` when implementing features that require complex database logic
- Use service prefix naming: `rsvp_*.sql`, `stats_*.sql`, etc.
- These are deployed via `deploy_all.ps1` script
- Examples: aggregation functions, state machines, complex filtering

### When to Use SQL Functions vs Application Code

**Use SQL functions in `/sql/` for:**
- Multi-table aggregations
- Performance-critical bulk operations  
- Complex business logic better expressed in SQL
- Logic that matches existing patterns (see `/sql/update_aggregated_*.sql`)

**Use application code for:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Token generation/validation
- Rate limiting
- Session management
- API orchestration

## File Creation
- Only create new files when explicitly requested by the user.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Clean up any temporary or test files created during development.

## Database Operations
- Provide all SQL queries as copyable code blocks.
- The user will execute the query and provide the results.
- Use the provided results for subsequent analysis and recommendations.
- **DO NOT** attempt to run database migrations (e.g., `prisma migrate`). The user will handle this.

## File Organization
- Organize code by feature, not by type
- Use App Router (Next.js 13+) - pages in `/app`, components in `/components`
- Backend assets: Supabase Edge Functions in `supabase/functions/`, SQL scripts in `sql/`
