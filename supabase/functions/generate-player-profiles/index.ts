LEAGUE CONTEXT (FOR COMPARATIVE INSIGHTS):
${JSON.stringify(playerData.league_context, null, 2)}

TARGET PLAYER DATA (FULL DETAILS):
${JSON.stringify(playerData.target_player, null, 2)}

**IMPORTANT DATA CLARIFICATIONS:**
- **selected_club**: This is the player's FAVORITE/SUPPORTED professional club (e.g., Tottenham, Arsenal) - NOT the team they play for
- **League Context**: This is a casual local football league where all players play together regardless of which professional clubs they support
- **DO NOT**: Say the player "plays for" their selected_club - they only SUPPORT that club

**CLUB MENTION POLICY - KEEP IT RARE:**
- **ONLY mention their favorite club in ~20% of profiles** (roughly 1 in 5 players)
- **SKIP club mentions** unless it genuinely adds humor or relevance to their story
- **WHEN TO MENTION**: Only if it creates a perfect setup for a joke or connects to their performance patterns
- **WHEN TO SKIP**: Most of the time - focus on their actual league performance instead
- **EXAMPLES**: 
  - GOOD: "Despite being a Spurs fan, he's surprisingly consistent" (if they have good consistency stats)
  - SKIP: Just mentioning "As a Chelsea supporter..." without it adding meaningful humor

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a profile for ${playerData.target_player.basic_info.name}. Use the league context for comparative insights and rankings.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WORD COUNT IS THE #1 PRIORITY - VERIFY WORD COUNT BEFORE SUBMITTING ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**üö® CRITICAL: DYNAMIC PROFILE LENGTH - WORD COUNT IS MANDATORY üö®**

STEP 1: Find games_played in profile_stats data
STEP 2: Apply the EXACT word count requirement below
STEP 3: COUNT YOUR WORDS as you write to ensure compliance

**MANDATORY WORD COUNT RULES:**

IF games_played < 25: 
- WRITE EXACTLY 50-100 words (NO MORE, NO LESS)
- Focus on potential and early moments

IF games_played >= 25 AND games_played < 50:
- WRITE EXACTLY 125-225 words (MINIMUM 125 WORDS REQUIRED)
- Include early career development

IF games_played >= 50 AND games_played < 100:
- WRITE EXACTLY 125-225 words (MINIMUM 125 WORDS REQUIRED)
- Include early career development

IF games_played >= 100 AND games_played < 150:
- WRITE EXACTLY 200-300 words (MINIMUM 200 WORDS REQUIRED)
- Include career development patterns

IF games_played >= 150 AND games_played < 200:
- WRITE EXACTLY 275-375 words (MINIMUM 275 WORDS REQUIRED)
- Include detailed career progression

IF games_played >= 200:
- WRITE EXACTLY 350-450 words (MINIMUM 350 WORDS REQUIRED)
- Comprehensive career retrospective with extensive detail

**EXAMPLES WITH WORD COUNT VERIFICATION:**
- games_played = 12 ‚Üí Write 50-100 words (count each word)
- games_played = 75 ‚Üí Write 125-225 words (minimum 125)  
- games_played = 175 ‚Üí Write 275-375 words (minimum 275)
- games_played = 500 ‚Üí Write 350-450 words (minimum 350)

**ENHANCED CAREER RETROSPECTIVE - For veterans especially:**
- Create a narrative arc: early days ‚Üí mid-career peaks ‚Üí recent form ‚Üí overall legacy
- Use yearly_stats progression to show evolution over time (improvement from early years, peak seasons, consistency patterns)
- Reference career highs and lows with humor: peak goal-scoring seasons, memorable droughts broken by hat-tricks, power_ratings trends over time
- Include milestone moments from match_streaks, season_stats, and personal_bests with dates
- For long-time players, discuss season-by-season progression and how their stats have trended (win rate over time, goal patterns, consistency evolution)
- Frame career lows (slumps, droughts, tough periods) humorously and positively: "bounced back from that goal drought like a champ", "survived the great slump of 2019 to emerge stronger"

**NARRATIVE VARIETY - Each player gets their authentic story:**
- Identify their DATA SIGNATURE: What makes THIS player genuinely unique?
- Choose 1-2 fitting narrative angles from: streaks, partnerships, breakthrough moments, consistency, clutch factor, quirky patterns, historical achievements
- Avoid formulaic approaches - if they're not a "partnership player," don't force chemistry stats
- Let their actual performance patterns drive the humor, not a template
- Some players are streak legends, others are steady performers, others are clutch heroes - match the story to the data

**HUMOR STYLE - Mine the data for character-driven comedy:**
- Turn statistical patterns into personality: "Scores in bunches", "Consistency incarnate"
- Use comparative data creatively: "Top quartile win rate, which is just showing off"
- Reference specific streaks/performances when they're genuinely notable: "That 15-match scoring drought followed by 8 goals in 5 games"
- Make teammate chemistry tangible only when it's their standout trait: "87% win rate with Sarah vs 52% apart - pure magic"
- Historical reverence for genuinely significant moments: "That 2019 unbeaten run is still WhatsApp legend"
- Frame lows humorously but positively: turn droughts into comeback stories, slumps into character-building moments

**LEAGUE CONTEXT USAGE:**
- Use league records to contextualize achievements: "Approaching the league record of X"
- Reference percentile rankings for bragging rights: "87th percentile goal threat"
- Compare to season honours for elite status: "Joining the exclusive group of season winners"
- Use league age and scale to frame career stages appropriately

**TONE:** Funny with light-hearted banter. Allow honest mentions of lows (slumps, droughts, tough periods) but frame them humorously and positively overall. Keep the tone fun, engaging, and league-specific without being harsh or negative.

**RETIRED PLAYERS:** Use retrospective style celebrating their legacy and career highlights with comprehensive career review.

**FORMAT:** Return just the profile text (no JSON wrapper needed for individual processing):

**üö® FINAL WARNING: WORD COUNT COMPLIANCE IS MANDATORY üö®**
COUNT EVERY SINGLE WORD AND VERIFY YOUR WORD COUNT MATCHES THE REQUIREMENT:

- If games_played < 25: Write 50-100 words EXACTLY (count each word)
- If games_played 25-49: Write 125-225 words MINIMUM (at least 125 words)
- If games_played 50-99: Write 125-225 words MINIMUM (at least 125 words)
- If games_played 100-149: Write 200-300 words MINIMUM (at least 200 words)
- If games_played 150-199: Write 275-375 words MINIMUM (at least 275 words)  
- If games_played 200+: Write 350-450 words MINIMUM (at least 350 words)

EXAMPLE: Lee Miles has 500+ games ‚Üí MUST write 350-450 words (minimum 350)

**FINAL REMINDER ON CLUB MENTIONS:**
- Skip mentioning their favorite club in MOST profiles (4 out of 5 times)
- Only mention if it creates genuine humor or irony with their performance
- Focus on their league achievements instead of professional club allegiances
