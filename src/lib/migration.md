# ‚öôÔ∏è Supabase Trigger Migration Plan

## ‚úÖ Goal

Migrate all Supabase trigger logic into the Node/React/Vercel app.  
Once complete, Supabase will be used for data storage only ‚Äî all business logic will be version-controlled, auditable, and editable within the app codebase (and maintainable by Cursor).

---

## üß† Match Types: Important Distinction

There are two types of "match" records in the app:

### üîπ `upcoming_matches`  
Used for **planned games** (pre-match team organization).  
- Logic: only one match can be active at a time.  
- ‚ùå No post-match processing happens here.

### üü¢ `matches` + `player_matches`  
Represent **played matches** and individual player stats.  
- ‚úÖ This is where all postprocessing logic applies (fantasy points, streaks, reports, etc).

---

## üö® When to Run Postprocessing

Run `/api/match-postprocess` after **any of the following:**
- A `match` is inserted, updated, or deleted
- A `player_match` is inserted, updated, or deleted

Do **not** run it for changes to `upcoming_matches`.

---

## ‚úÖ Logic to Migrate into the App

For each Supabase function listed below:
- Recreate the logic in a service file in `/lib/stats`
- Call each one from `/api/match-postprocess.ts` after a match or player stat update

---

## üìÇ Suggested Folder Layout

```
/lib
  /stats
    updateRecentPerformance.ts
    updateAllTimeStats.ts
    updateSeasonHonours.ts
    updateHalfAndFullSeasonStats.ts
    updateMatchReportCache.ts
    helpers.ts
/api
  match-postprocess.ts
```

---

## üì¶ Function: `check_only_one_active_upcoming_match`

**Trigger Type:** BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE on `upcoming_matches`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.check_only_one_active_upcoming_match()
 RETURNS trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.is_active = TRUE THEN
    UPDATE upcoming_matches
    SET is_active = FALSE
    WHERE upcoming_match_id <> NEW.upcoming_match_id AND is_active = TRUE;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$function$
```
üìå Recreate this logic in your API route that creates/updates planned matches.

---

## üì¶ Function: `update_team_slots_timestamp`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_team_slots_timestamp()
 RETURNS trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$function$
```
üìå Add `updated_at = new Date()` manually in your `team_slots` update handler.

---

## üì¶ Function: `handle_match_update`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_match_update()
 RETURNS trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$

üìå Rebuild this in `/lib/stats/updateRecentPerformance.ts`.
This service is **solely responsible** for calculating and updating recent performance metrics, including:
- `last_5_games`: A JSON array containing details of the last 5 matches played.
- `last_5_goals`: The sum of goals scored in the last 5 matches played.
- `last_5_results`: A representation (e.g., 'WDLWL', or an array `['W', 'D', 'L', 'W', 'L']`) of the results from the last 5 matches played (derived from `last_5_games`).
Used for recent form data (e.g. pills in UI).

## üì¶ Function: `populate_all_time_stats`

**Original Trigger:** `populate_all_time_stats()` function triggered AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `player_matches`.

```sql
-- (Original complex SQL trigger code for all-time stats)
-- ... Includes aggregation, percentage calculations, fantasy points, HoF logic ...
```

üìå **Migrated Logic:** Recreated in `src/lib/stats/updateAllTimeStats.ts`.
- **Responsibilities:** Calculates all-time player statistics and Hall of Fame rankings.
- **Implementation:**
    - Fetches all non-ringer/non-retired `player_matches`.
    - Aggregates base stats (wins, goals, etc.) in memory using a Map.
    - Calculates derived stats (percentages, points per game).
    - Uses `helpers.ts` -> `calculateFantasyPointsForMatch()` for fantasy points, reading values from the passed `config` object.
    - Uses `helpers.ts` -> `getTopRanked()` to determine Hall of Fame entries based on config values (`games_required_for_hof`, `hall_of_fame_limit`).
    - `minutes_per_goal` calculation uses `config.match_duration_minutes`.
    - Clears and inserts into `aggregated_all_time_stats` and `aggregated_hall_of_fame` tables (verify exact Prisma model name like `prisma.aggregated_all_time_stats` after running `prisma generate`).

## üì¶ Function: `populate_honour_roll_data`

**Original Trigger:** `populate_honour_roll_data()` function triggered AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `player_matches`.

```sql
-- (Original complex SQL trigger code for season honours and records)
-- ... Includes window functions, RANK(), JSON aggregation for winners/records ...
```

üìå **Migrated Logic:** Recreated in `src/lib/stats/updateSeasonHonours.ts`.
- **Responsibilities:** Calculates past season honours (winners, top scorers per year) and all-time records (streaks, biggest win, etc.).
- **Implementation:**
    - Uses the `config` object for `min_games_for_honours`, `min_streak_length` and fantasy points (embedded in SQL for now).
    - Calculates honours and records primarily using complex `$queryRaw` statements due to reliance on window functions and specific SQL aggregation patterns.
    - Clears and inserts into `aggregated_season_honours` and `aggregated_records` tables.
    - **Note:** Does not currently use calculation helpers from `helpers.ts` due to the nature of the raw SQL queries.

üìå Rebuild in `/lib/stats/updateMatchReportCache.ts`.
Run it always after a match update (since "most recent match" may change).

**Dependencies:** This function originally called `fix_all_streaks()`, `fix_all_milestones()`, and `calculate_leaders_for_match()`.
- **Decision:** The logic from these helper functions **will be migrated into TypeScript** and incorporated directly within `updateMatchReportCache.ts` or potentially broken out into separate TypeScript helper services called by it. They will *not* remain as separate SQL functions to be called via raw SQL.
- Ensure `app_config` values (streak thresholds) are fetched within the Node.js service.

## üîß Postprocess Endpoint: `/api/match-postprocess.ts`

This API route acts as the orchestrator for all post-match processing logic.

**Responsibilities:**
- Call the migrated service functions in the correct order:
  ```ts
  // Ensure correct imports for each service function
  await updateRecentPerformance();
  await updateAllTimeStats();
  await updateSeasonHonours();
  await updateHalfAndFullSeasonStats(); // Derived from handle_match_update
  await updateMatchReportCache();
  ```
- Trigger Conditions: Run this **only after changes to `matches` or `player_matches`**, not `upcoming_matches`.
- **Admin Only:** Access to this endpoint must be restricted to authenticated admin users.
- **Future-Proofing:** While not immediately necessary (due to admin-only access), design with potential future needs in mind:
    - *Batch Processing:* Could the logic be adapted to process multiple match updates at once?
    - *Retries:* Implement robust error handling and consider idempotency to allow for safe retries if a step fails.

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Notes & Considerations

- **Error Handling:**
    - Each service function (`updateRecentPerformance`, `updateAllTimeStats`, etc.) should handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., database connection issues, calculation errors) and log them appropriately.
    - The main orchestration function in `/api/match-postprocess.ts` should ideally wrap the sequence of service calls in a **database transaction**. If any step fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back to maintain data consistency. If full transactions are complex with the chosen database client/ORM, simulate this by implementing manual rollback logic for each step in case of a failure in a subsequent step.
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - The current plan recalculates many potentially expensive stats (all-time, honours, records) after every single match update.
    - **Future Consideration:** For performance scaling, investigate running computationally intensive calculations less frequently. For example:
        - `updateAllTimeStats` and `updateSeasonHonours` (especially the records part) might only need to run nightly or weekly via a scheduled job, rather than after every match.
        - `updateMatchReportCache` only needs to run if the *most recent* match changes, or if underlying data it depends on (like streaks/milestones included in the report) is updated.
- **Configuration:** Ensure all hardcoded values currently in SQL (fantasy points, streak thresholds, min games played for honours) are externalized into application configuration (e.g., environment variables, config files) in the Node.js implementation.
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test the output of the migrated TypeScript functions against the output of the original Supabase SQL triggers using sample data to ensure accuracy.
- **Logging:** Add detailed logging (including timing for each step) within the post-processing endpoint and service functions to aid debugging and performance monitoring.
- **Trigger Deletion:** Once the migration is complete and thoroughly tested, the original Supabase triggers can be safely deleted.
- **Naming:** Consider renaming `/api/match-postprocess.ts` to something more specific like `/api/admin/postprocess-played-match` to reflect its purpose and access restrictions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Values

Several calculation parameters are now stored in the `app_config` table and passed via the `AppConfig` object:

- **Fantasy Points:** `fantasy_win_points`, `fantasy_draw_points`, etc. (Already existed)
- `match_duration_minutes`: Assumed duration of a match for `minutes_per_goal` calculation (Default: 60).
- `hall_of_fame_limit`: Max number of ranked entries per Hall of Fame category (Default: 10).
- `games_required_for_hof`: Minimum games played for a player to be eligible for *any* Hall of Fame category (Default: 50).
- `min_games_for_honours`: Minimum games played in a year for season honours eligibility (Default: 10).
- `min_streak_length`: Minimum length for a streak to be recorded (Default: 3).

Ensure these keys exist in your `app_config` table.
