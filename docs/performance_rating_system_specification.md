# BerkoTNF Performance Rating System Specification

**Version:** 3.4  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** UNIFIED TIER-BASED SYSTEM - Consistent Logic Across All Three Metrics

**Version 3.4 Changes:**
- **UNIFIED:** All three metrics now use identical tier-based percentage change limits (±30%/±40%/±50% for NEW/DEVELOPING/ESTABLISHED)
- **CONSISTENT:** Goal threat and participation sparklines now apply tier-based minimum game requirements (like power rating)
- **REFINED:** Removed participation outlier protection (attendance is behavioral truth, not performance)
- **ARCHITECTURAL:** Fixed time contamination where future outliers affected historical sparkline percentages
- **UI CONSISTENCY:** Fixed goal threat and power rating to use percentile ranking instead of ratio-to-max for consistent scaling
- **VALIDATED:** Comprehensive consistency review ensures all metrics follow same sophisticated logic patterns

**Version 3.3 Changes:**
- **ENHANCED:** Added sophisticated outlier detection with proportional capping for ESTABLISHED players
- **BIDIRECTIONAL:** Protects against both rating inflation (weak players with one good period) and deflation (champions with one poor period)
- **PROPORTIONAL:** Outliers still influence ratings but proportionate to established ability (0.6x to 1.6x historical average)
- **VALIDATED:** Approach confirmed as "statistically sound" by academic review and aligns with sports analytics best practices
- **REAL-WORLD TESTED:** Solves Scott Daly case study (2024 champion) where single poor period caused disproportionate rating drop

**Version 3.2 Changes:**
- **FIXED:** Backwards blending ratios - NEW players now trust recent form 90%, ESTABLISHED players trust historical 70%
- **ENHANCED:** Removed all fake default values - NULL values now show real data quality issues instead of misleading averages
- **ENABLED:** Natural aging decline - removed artificial rating floors and outlier caps that prevented older players from declining
- **IMPROVED:** Fixed negative-to-positive transition handling in trend calculations
- **STANDARDIZED:** All three metrics use logical, consistent approaches without artificial protection

**Version 3.1 Changes:**
- **ENHANCED:** Participation calculation now uses same sophisticated trend analysis as Power Rating and Goal Threat
- **IMPROVED:** Multi-tiered confidence weighting applied to participation metric
- **STANDARDIZED:** All three metrics (Power Rating + Goal Threat + Participation) use identical trend calculation logic
- **OPTIMIZED:** Eliminates naive 100% participation rates from small sample periods

**Version 3.0 Changes:**
- **REMOVED:** Defensive Score metric due to extreme clustering (coefficient of variation 0.044)
- **SIMPLIFIED:** 3-metric system reduced to 2-metric system (Power Rating + Goal Threat)

## System Overview

The BerkoTNF Performance Rating System is a sophisticated, adaptive rating algorithm designed to provide fair, accurate, and responsive player performance metrics across different experience levels and playing patterns.

**MAJOR REDESIGN - Version 3.0:**
Following comprehensive validation analysis, the system has been redesigned from a 3-metric to a **2-metric approach**. The defensive score metric was removed due to extreme clustering providing minimal player differentiation.

### Key Metrics Calculated

**Core Rating Metrics (All with Sophisticated Trend Analysis):**
- **`trend_rating`**: Forward-looking performance rating (Power Rating) based on recent form and historical trends
- **`trend_goal_threat`**: Predictive goal-scoring ability (Goal Threat) capped at 1.5 goals per weighted game
- **`trend_participation`**: Intelligent attendance percentage (Participation) with confidence weighting and multi-block analysis

**Display-Only Metrics (UI Enhancement):**
- **`participation_rate`**: Player attendance percentage (Participation) for team management insights

**REMOVED:** `defensive_score` - Extreme clustering (0.500-0.578 range) provided minimal differentiation

### Data Sources

- **6-month historical blocks**: Weighted performance data aggregated into rolling 6-month periods  
- **Match-level data**: Individual game results, goals, fantasy points (clean sheets removed)
- **Time-decay weighting**: Recent performances weighted more heavily using exponential decay

---

## Sophisticated Participation Calculation (Version 3.1)

### The Problem with Naive Participation

Previous versions used simple participation calculation:
```
participation = games_played / games_possible × 100
```

This caused issues:
- **Small Sample Bias**: 3/3 games = 100% (misleading)
- **No Historical Context**: Ignored long-term attendance patterns
- **No Confidence Weighting**: Treated all sample sizes equally

### Solution: Apply Same Sophistication as Power Rating

**Participation now uses identical multi-tiered logic:**

#### Tier-Based Minimums
- **NEW** (0-30 games): 3+ games per block required
- **DEVELOPING** (31-75 games): 6+ games per block required  
- **ESTABLISHED** (75+ games): 10+ games per block required

#### Trend Analysis
```sql
-- Consistent trend (>10% variation)
participation_trend = current_participation × (1 + capped_percentage_change)
-- Change limits: ±25% (more conservative than power rating)

-- Inconsistent trend (≤10% variation)  
participation_trend = 0.6 × current_participation + 0.4 × previous_participation
```

#### Confidence Weighting by Tier
```sql
confidence_weight = MIN(1.0, actual_games / tier_minimum_games)

-- NEW players: Heavy blending with long-term average
participation = (0.4 × confidence × trend) + (0.6 × long_term_avg)

-- DEVELOPING players: Moderate blending  
participation = (0.7 × confidence × trend) + (0.3 × long_term_avg)

-- ESTABLISHED players: Minimal blending, outlier protection only
```

#### Outlier Protection (Established Players)
```sql
-- Allow 30% drops but prevent catastrophic attendance crashes
IF participation < long_term_avg × 0.3 THEN
    participation = MAX(participation, long_term_avg × 0.3)
END IF
```

### Real-World Example: Sophisticated vs Naive

**Player with attendance history: [20%, 40%, 85%, 100% (3 games)]**

**Naive Calculation**: 100% ← misleading  
**Sophisticated Calculation**: ~87% ← trending up from 85% with low confidence weighting

### Benefits

1. **Eliminates Small Sample Bias**: No more false 100% rates
2. **Historical Context**: Considers long-term attendance patterns
3. **Confidence Weighting**: Accounts for sample size reliability
4. **Trend Analysis**: Shows improving/declining attendance patterns
5. **Outlier Protection**: Prevents single-period crashes from dominating

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Fairness Across Experience Levels**
Different players require different treatment based on their experience and data availability.

### 2. **Protection Against Small Sample Bias**
Temporary slumps or hot streaks shouldn't drastically alter long-term ratings for experienced players.

### 3. **Responsiveness for Development**
New and developing players need ratings that reflect their current ability and improvement.

### 4. **Robustness Against Outliers**
The system must handle extreme performances, seasonal gaps, and unusual circumstances.

### 5. **Transparency and Explainability**
Every calculation should be logical, defensible, and traceable.

---

## Multi-Tiered Architecture

The system adapts its behavior based on player experience level, implementing different standards and protections for each tier.

### Tier Classification

| Tier | Total Career Games | Min Block Size | Philosophy |
|------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| **NEW** | 0-30 games | 3 games | Help new players establish themselves |
| **DEVELOPING** | 31-75 games | 6 games | Balance reliability with responsiveness |
| **ESTABLISHED** | 75+ games | 10 games | Protect consistency from temporary variance |

### Tier-Specific Behaviors

#### NEW Players (0-30 games)
- **Block Requirement**: Minimum 3 games per 6-month block
- **Trend Limits**: ±30% maximum change between blocks
- **Confidence Blending**: 40% recent form, 60% long-term average/league defaults
- **Rating Floor**: 3.0 minimum (provides confidence boost)
- **Philosophy**: "Get them started with reasonable ratings while preventing false confidence from tiny samples"

#### DEVELOPING Players (31-75 games)
- **Block Requirement**: Minimum 6 games per 6-month block  
- **Trend Limits**: ±40% maximum change between blocks
- **Confidence Blending**: 70% recent form, 30% long-term average
- **Rating Floor**: 2.0 minimum
- **Philosophy**: "Building reliable data while maintaining responsiveness to improvement"

#### ESTABLISHED Players (75+ games)
- **Block Requirement**: Minimum 10 games per 6-month block
- **Trend Limits**: ±50% maximum change between blocks
- **Confidence Blending**: Minimal blending, only for extreme outliers (>150% or <50% of long-term average)
- **Rating Floor**: 1.0 minimum
- **Philosophy**: "Protect consistent performers from temporary variance while allowing for real changes"

---

## Historical Blocks Framework

### Block Structure

Each historical block represents a 6-month period containing:

```json
{
  "start_date": "2024-01-01",
  "end_date": "2024-06-30", 
  "fantasy_points": 74.59,        // Time-decay weighted total (for Power Rating)
  "goals": 8.76,                  // Time-decay weighted total (for Goal Threat)
  "games_played": 24,             // Games attended by player
  "games_possible": 28,           // Total games available in period
  "participation_rate": 0.857,    // Attendance percentage (24/28 = 85.7%)
  "weights_sum": 17.28            // Sum of decay weights
  // REMOVED: "goals_conceded": 0.347 - No longer needed for defensive calculations
  // REMOVED: "clean_sheets": 0 - No longer needed for defensive calculations
}
```

### Time-Decay Weighting

Recent performances within each block are weighted more heavily:

```
weight = 2^(-days_ago / 180)
```

Where `days_ago` is the number of days between the match date and the end of the block period.

**Rationale**: A match played at the beginning of a 6-month period should have less influence than one played at the end, reflecting the player's trajectory within that period.

### Block Creation Logic

1. **Player-Specific Years Only**: Blocks are only created for years where the player actually has matches
2. **Minimum Data Threshold**: Empty blocks (0 games) are never created
3. **Current Year Handling**: Partial blocks are allowed for the current year if we're past June 30th
4. **Data Integrity**: All calculations include null-safety and division-by-zero protection

---

## Trend Calculation Engine

### Block Selection Process

1. **Primary Selection**: Use the two most recent blocks that meet the tier's minimum game requirement
2. **Fallback for Established Players**: If no blocks meet the 10-game requirement, fall back to 5+ game blocks
3. **Final Fallback**: Use any valid blocks if necessary

### Trend Analysis Types

#### Consistent Trend (>10% variation between blocks)
When a player shows significant change between their two most recent qualifying blocks:

```
percentage_change = (current_rating - previous_rating) / previous_rating
trend_rating = current_rating × (1 + capped_percentage_change)
```

**Unified Tier-Based Percentage Change Caps (Applied to All Three Metrics)**:
- **NEW Players (0-30 games)**: ±30% maximum change per period
- **DEVELOPING Players (31-75 games)**: ±40% maximum change per period  
- **ESTABLISHED Players (75+ games)**: ±50% maximum change per period

**Rationale for Tier-Based Approach**:
- **NEW**: Don't know true level yet, limit volatility to prevent overreaction to small samples
- **DEVELOPING**: Finding their level, allow moderate swings as they discover their role
- **ESTABLISHED**: Know their baseline, larger swings more likely genuine (new position, injury recovery, etc.)

**Applied Consistently Across**:
- ✅ **Power Rating**: Core performance metric
- ✅ **Goal Threat**: Scoring ability (NEW players very erratic, ESTABLISHED can have hot streaks)  
- ✅ **Participation**: Attendance patterns (NEW testing waters, ESTABLISHED life changes)

#### Inconsistent Trend (≤10% variation between blocks)
When performance is relatively stable:

```
trend_rating = 0.6 × current_rating + 0.4 × previous_rating
trend_goal_threat = 0.6 × current_goals + 0.4 × previous_goals
trend_participation = 0.6 × current_participation + 0.4 × previous_participation
```

### Unified Sparkline Display Logic

**Tier-Based Minimum Game Requirements** (Applied Consistently):
- **Power Rating**: Always displayed (drives core rating calculation)
- **Goal Threat**: Only displayed when period meets tier minimum games requirement
- **Participation**: Only displayed when period meets tier minimum games requirement

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **No misleading percentages** from insufficient sample sizes
- ✅ **Honest data representation** (don't show stats when unreliable)  
- ✅ **Consistent user experience** across all three metrics

### Unified UI Percentage Calculation

**Problem Solved**: Historical inconsistency where different metrics used different calculation methods:
- **Historical Sparklines**: Used period-specific percentile ranking ✅
- **Current Overall Percentages**: Used ratio-to-maximum scaling ❌

**Unified Solution**: All current and historical percentages now use **percentile ranking**:

```javascript
// BEFORE (inconsistent):
goal_threat_percentage = (player_value / league_maximum) × 100  // Ratio method

// AFTER (consistent):
goal_threat_percentage = (players_below_or_equal / total_qualified_players) × 100  // Percentile method
```

**Real-World Impact**:
- **Scott Daly Example**: Goal threat changed from 30% (ratio) to 69% (percentile) - much more accurate!
- **Historical vs Current**: Now consistent calculation methods across time
- **User Trust**: Percentages now reflect true league ranking, not arbitrary scaling

### Single Block Handling

For players with only one qualifying block:
- Use that block's metrics directly
- Apply tier-appropriate minimum rating floors
- Ensure non-negative goal threat values

### Enhanced Outlier Protection for Established Players

**Problem**: Exceptional performers like championship winners can have their ratings catastrophically impacted by single poor periods, while poor performers can get false inflation from single good periods.

**Solution**: For ESTABLISHED players only, the system applies sophisticated outlier detection with proportional capping to prevent statistical anomalies from dominating trend calculations.

#### Outlier Detection Thresholds
```
-- Power Rating Outliers
negative_outlier = current_rating < (long_term_average × 0.45)  // 55% below historical
positive_outlier = current_rating > (long_term_average × 2.5)   // 150% above historical

-- Goal Threat Outliers (more lenient thresholds)
negative_outlier = current_goals < (long_term_average × 0.3)    // 70% below historical  
positive_outlier = current_goals > (long_term_average × 3.0)    // 200% above historical
```

#### Proportional Capping Logic
```sql
-- Power Rating Capping
IF negative_outlier THEN capped_rating = long_term_average × 0.6  // 40% below average
IF positive_outlier THEN capped_rating = long_term_average × 1.6  // 60% above average

-- Goal Threat Capping  
IF negative_outlier THEN capped_goals = long_term_average × 0.5   // 50% below average
IF positive_outlier THEN capped_goals = long_term_average × 2.0   // 100% above average
```

#### Real-World Example: Scott Daly Case Study
**Player Profile**: ESTABLISHED tier, 2024 league champion
**Performance History**: [10.7, 14.2, 13.1, 3.9] PPG over 4 periods
- **Historical Average**: 12.7 PPG (championship level)
- **Outlier Period**: 3.9 PPG (disaster period, 69% below average)
- **Detection**: 3.9 < (12.7 × 0.45 = 5.72) → **triggers outlier protection**
- **Capping**: 3.9 → 7.6 PPG (12.7 × 0.6)
- **Result**: Rating drops from ~85th to ~70th percentile instead of catastrophic fall to 55th percentile

#### Bidirectional Protection Benefits
- **Prevents Rating Inflation**: Weak players with one good period don't become false elites
- **Prevents Rating Deflation**: Champions with one poor period don't become underrated
- **Maintains Proportionality**: Outliers still influence ratings but proportionate to established ability
- **Preserves Trend Detection**: Genuine changes over multiple periods still register correctly

#### Implementation Details
- **Applied Before Trend Calculation**: Outlier detection occurs after block aggregation but before variation analysis
- **Both Blocks Protected**: Current and previous blocks both receive outlier detection
- **Asymmetric Thresholds**: Reflects reality that performance declines are steeper than improvements
- **Diagnostic Logging**: System logs when outlier capping is applied for transparency

#### Statistical Validation
- **Professor Review**: Approach validated as "statistically sound" with "basic heuristic" properties
- **Aligns with Winsorization**: Similar to standard outlier treatment in sports analytics
- **Preserves System Properties**: Maintains tier-based responsiveness and confidence weighting

## User Interface Percentage Scaling

### Problem with Absolute Maximums

Early implementations used absolute league maximums (highest individual ratings) for 100% scaling. This created several issues:

- **Small-sample outliers** (players with 5-10 games getting lucky) would set unrealistic maximums
- **Established champions** would show artificially low percentages despite proven excellence
- **Scale distortion** where one anomalous performance affected all other players' perceived ratings

### Solution: Qualified Maximum Scaling

The system now uses **qualified maximum** values as the 100% benchmark - only players with proven sample sizes (15+ games) are considered when setting the scale ceiling.

#### Implementation
```javascript
// Filter to only established players (15+ games)
const qualifiedPlayers = leagueStats.filter(s => s.effective_games >= 15);

// Use qualified maximum for balancing metrics
power_rating_100 = Math.max(...qualifiedPlayers.map(s => s.trend_rating))
goal_threat_100 = Math.max(...qualifiedPlayers.map(s => s.trend_goal_threat))

// Use simple percentage for participation (already 0-100%)
participation_display = participation_rate * 100  // e.g., 0.857 → 85.7%

// Player percentage = MIN(100%, (player_value / benchmark) × 100)
```

#### Scaling Rationale

**Power Rating & Goal Threat**: Use qualified maximum because both metrics have good natural spread across the player pool and small-sample outliers can be problematic for scaling.

**Participation**: Uses direct percentage calculation (games_attended / games_possible × 100) providing natural 0-100% range with excellent differentiation.

**REMOVED - Defensive Score**: Previously used 90th percentile due to extreme clustering (0.500-0.578 range), but metric removed entirely due to minimal differentiation capability.

#### Benefits
- **Prevents outlier distortion**: Small-sample flukes (e.g., 6-game winning streaks) don't break everyone else's scale
- **Proven performance benchmark**: 100% = "best established player", not "luckiest newcomer"
- **Clean UI**: No percentages exceed 100% (capped for display)
- **Realistic scaling**: Champions show appropriate percentages without outlier inflation

#### Example Impact
**Sean McKay (Multiple Champion) vs Dave Wates (6-game newcomer)**:
- **Old Absolute Maximum**: 8.2 ÷ 27.9 = 29% ❌ (Dave's 6-game fluke ruins Sean's scale)
- **New Qualified Maximum**: 8.2 ÷ ~12.0 = 68% ✅ (Dave excluded, Sean shows appropriate strength)

---

## Confidence Weighting System

### Confidence Weight Calculation

```
confidence_weight = MIN(1.0, actual_games / tier_minimum_games)
```

This represents how much we trust the recent block based on its sample size.

### Blending Formula by Tier

#### NEW Players
```
final_rating = (0.4 × confidence × trend_rating) + 
               (0.6 × long_term_average) + 
               ((1 - confidence) × 5.35)  // League default
```

#### DEVELOPING Players  
```
final_rating = (0.7 × confidence × trend_rating) + 
               ((1 - 0.7 × confidence) × long_term_average)
```

#### ESTABLISHED Players
```
// Only blend if trend is extreme outlier (>150% or <50% of long-term)
if (trend_rating > long_term_avg × 1.5 OR trend_rating < long_term_avg × 0.5):
    final_rating = (0.8 × confidence × trend_rating) + 
                   ((1 - 0.8 × confidence) × long_term_average)
```

### Long-Term Average Calculation

Only includes blocks that meet tier-appropriate minimum game requirements:
- NEW: 2+ games per block
- DEVELOPING: 4+ games per block  
- ESTABLISHED: 6+ games per block

---

## Edge Case Handling

### Zero Goal Threat Resolution

When `trend_goal_threat = 0` but the player has multiple historical blocks:

1. Calculate average goals per weighted game from all blocks with goals
2. Only consider blocks with 3+ games for reliability
3. Use this historical average instead of zero

**Rationale**: A single goal-less block doesn't mean a player can't score.

### Negative Rating Protection

When recent performance is negative but historical performance is positive:

```
```

---

## Core Logic Fixes (Version 3.2)

### The Problem: Backwards Blending Ratios

**Previous (Illogical):**
```sql
NEW: 40% recent + 60% historical      -- "Don't trust recent yet" 
DEVELOPING: 70% recent + 30% historical
ESTABLISHED: 90% recent + 10% historical -- "Fully trust recent"
```

**This was backwards!** For established players with 100+ games of proven ability, a 6-month hot streak shouldn't dominate their rating.

**Fixed (Logical):**
```sql
NEW: 90% recent + 10% historical      -- "Recent form is all we know"
DEVELOPING: 70% recent + 30% historical -- "Building confidence"  
ESTABLISHED: 30% recent + 70% historical -- "We know who you are"
```

### The Problem: Fake Default Values

**Previous (Misleading):**
- Players with no data: `trend_rating = 5.35` (fake "average" player)
- Missing goal data: `trend_goal_threat = 0.5` (fake league average)
- No participation data: `participation = 75%` (fake attendance rate)

**Fixed (Transparent):**
- Players with no data: `trend_rating = NULL` → UI shows "Insufficient data"
- Missing data: No fake values → Real data quality issues visible

### The Problem: Prevented Aging Decline

**Previous (Artificial Protection):**
```sql
-- Prevented natural aging decline
v_trend_rating := GREATEST(v_trend_rating, v_long_term_avg * 0.4)  -- 40% floor
v_trend_rating := GREATEST(1.0, v_trend_rating)  -- Minimum 1.0 rating
```

**Fixed (Natural Aging):**
- Removed all artificial rating floors
- Removed outlier caps that prevented decline
- Players can now naturally decline with age/form changes

### The Problem: Negative Transition Math

**Previous (Broken):**
```sql
-- Failed on negative-to-positive transitions
IF v_prev_block_rating > 0 THEN
    v_variation := calculate_variation()
ELSE
    v_variation := 0  -- Wrong! Ignored major improvements
END IF
```

**Fixed (Proper Handling):**
```sql
-- Handles all transitions correctly
IF negative_to_positive THEN
    v_variation := 100  -- Force consistent trend recognition
ELSIF both_negative THEN  
    v_variation := calculate_on_absolute_values()
END IF
```
