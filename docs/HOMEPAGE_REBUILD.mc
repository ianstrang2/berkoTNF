Final CTA band


You can keep a lot of your current content, but we’ll package it in shorter blocks, with more visual weight on phones, bullets over paragraphs, and clear two-sided story: players + captains.

1. Hero Section
Goal: Explain Capo in 5 seconds. Hype + clarity + CTA.
Layout (desktop)
Left: Text (H1, H2, bullets, CTAs)


Right: Tall phone mockup (or 2–3 overlapping phones) showing:


stats/profile screen


team balance screen


match report / feed


On mobile, stack: phone first or H1 first (whichever looks best), then CTA.
Suggested animation
Phone(s) slide in / gently float.


Maybe a subtle auto-playing in-app scroll or GIF (but not noisy).


CTA button has micro hover effect.


Copy
H1
The 5-a-side app your mates will obsess over.
H2
Make your kickabout something they talk about all week.
One-liner
Capo is the casual football app that turns your weekly game into a proper experience — fantasy-style stats and profiles for the players, no-stress admin for the organiser, and AI-balanced teams every time.
Key bullets (2 columns or inline icons):
✅ Player stats, streaks & AI profiles


✅ AI-balanced teams = no more arguments


✅ RSVPs, dropouts & payments handled


Primary CTA
Get the app
(You can keep your “Free forever for organisers” line, but make it secondary.)
Reassurance line under CTA
Free forever for organisers.
 Players only pay a small per-match fee if you use in-app payments.

2. Players Section – “Hype & identity”
This is where your “Your football story, told properly” stuff lives, but we’ll make it more scannable.
Layout
Section title centred, then:
Left: Phone mockup slider / carousel (screens: AI bio, stats screen, streaks, match report).


Right: Text cards / bullets.


On mobile: phone on top, text below.
Suggested animation
Phone carousel auto-advances every few seconds.


Each feature bullet fades in as the corresponding screen comes into view (if you want to be fancy).


Copy
Section label
FOR PLAYERS
H2
Your football story, told properly.
Intro sentence (shorter than current):
Capo turns your casual five-a-side into something everyone actually cares about — stats, streaks, match reports and AI-written profiles that make every game part of a bigger story.
Feature bullets (reuse your current ideas, trimmed):
Subhead: AI-written player profiles
Capo watches your games, goals, wins, losses, streaks and form, and turns them into a living player bio. It updates every week. It remembers everything. It becomes the story of your kickabout career.
Subhead: Streaks & form badges for banter
Attendance runs, scoring streaks, unbeaten patches, grim winless droughts — Capo tracks it all and shows your current “heat” with simple badges. Everyone knows who’s flying and who’s gone missing.
Subhead: Fantasy-style scoring – but it’s actually you
Every match feeds your season points: appearances, goals, wins, clean sheets, big results. Leaderboards shift every week. Suddenly, everyone checks where they stand.
Subhead: Graphs & charts that show your rise (or wobble)
Clean visuals of your minutes, goals and points-per-game over time. You can literally see your form curve — and everyone else’s.
Subhead: Legends, records & lore
Biggest nights, longest streaks, wildest defeats, weird milestones — all logged. Your group stops being “just a chat” and starts to feel like it has history.

3. Organisers Section – “Your game, sorted”
This is your current “FOR CAPTAINS” section, but tightened.
Layout
Right: Phone screenshot of organiser dashboard: RSVPs, waitlist, payments.


Left: Text.


On mobile: text first, then phone.
Suggested animation
Phone card from left/right on scroll.


Little “tick” animation for bullet points if you want micro delight.


Copy
Section label
FOR ORGANISERS
H2
Your game, sorted — without losing the vibe.
Intro:
Capo takes the admin you’ve quietly carried for years — chasing replies, juggling dropouts, collecting money — and wraps it into one clean flow. You still run the group. Capo just takes the stress away.
Feature bullets:
Subhead: One-tap RSVPs
Players tap IN or OUT. You see your numbers instantly — no scrolling, no guessing, no “who’s actually coming tonight?”.
Subhead: Automatic waitlist
If someone drops out, Capo fills the spot from your waiting list. You don’t even open the chat.
Subhead: Tiered invites for your A/B/C list
Your core players get the first invite. If spaces remain, it opens to the wider group. Regulars feel valued. Games fill faster.
Subhead: Payments handled upfront
Players pay when they RSVP. You receive automatic payouts every match. No awkward chasing, no IOUs, no fronting pitch money.
(Keep your “free for organisers” messaging, possibly as a badge near here too.)

4. Fair Teams Section – “AI-balanced, zero effort”
H2
Fair teams. Better games. Zero effort.
Tagline
Team selection that takes seconds — not arguments.
Intro paragraph
Capo automatically builds balanced teams using everyone’s recent performances.
 No sliders. No spreadsheets. No long chats. It just works — and it feels fair.
Bullets (friendly + light):
Balanced automatically
Players’ form and performances feed into a simple balancing engine that gives you fair sides out of the box.
Better football for everyone
Close, competitive games are more fun — and they keep people coming back.
Tweak when you want
Move players between teams or nudge things manually if you fancy it. Capo stays simple by default, powerful if you need it.
Friendly transparency
See a light “balance at a glance” score. No nerdy breakdowns. No need to justify anything. Just confidence that the game feels right.
Visual
A phone showing two clean team lists with a small “Balanced” tag.


No sliders.


No complicated UI.


No intimidating settings.


Animation
Teams slide into place.


A subtle “Balanced ✓” fades in.


That’s it.




5. “Built for real 5-a-side life” / Match Control
This is your Match Control Centre + “How it fits into your week” combined, but with fewer words.
Layout
Left: Phone showing “Match Control Centre”


Right: Short description & bullet list.


Underneath, a horizontal 4–5 step timeline (“How Capo fits into your week”).
Suggested animation
Step timeline: numbers 1→5 light up as you scroll or hover.

Section label
BUILT FOR REAL 5-A-SIDE LIFE
H2
Built for the chaos around the game.
Intro:
Capo isn’t just a pretty stats app. It’s built for all the messy stuff before and after a match — the WhatsApp noise, the last-minute guests, the final score, the post-game chat.
Subhead: Match Control Centre
One pitch-side screen with everything: the player pool, the teams, the score entry and the finish button. Mark the game as done and Capo updates:
Tables


Streaks


Points


Records


Chemistry


Performance graphs


Every player’s AI profile


The match report


Your post-game admin fits inside a single tap.
Then a mini “How your week looks with Capo” timeline:
H3

Steps (1–5)

 Create your club, share the join code, players hop in.


Create a match
 Set time & place. Players RSVP and pay.

You play — then log the result in seconds
 Add the score, hit finish. That’s it.


Capo handles all the hype
 Stats, streaks, AI profiles and the match report are ready for the group chat — and for the pub.



6. Comparison Section – “Capo vs WhatsApp vs Spond”
Short, sharp, visual. This directly hits their “should we switch?” question.
Layout
Simple 3-column table:
Column 1: WhatsApp


Column 2: Spond


Column 3: Capo (highlighted)


Suggested animation
Columns fade in and Capo column slightly pops or has a glow.


On hover, show one extra line of detail per row.


Copy
H2
Why use Capo instead of just WhatsApp or Spond?
Subheading line:

Spond: ❌ Not built for this


Capo: ✅ AI-balanced teams with clear Balance Score


Row: Vibes / identity
WhatsApp: 🔥 Fun but messy


Spond: 🥶 Efficient but lifeless


Capo: ⚡ Built for mates, banter and bragging rights



7. Origin Story Section
This is huge for trust + relatability.
Layout
Left: Short story text.


Right: Image of your old spreadsheet / a “before vs after” graphic / a fun illustration.


Suggested animation
Old spreadsheet image fades into the current app UI, like “we’ve evolved”.


Copy
H2
Built by the guys who actually run a kickabout.
Paragraph:
We ran the same five-a-side for eight years.
 First with a simple spreadsheet. Then with a ridiculous one full of graphs, macros and little hacks to track streaks and balance teams.
 In 2025, we finally admitted it needed a proper home — so we taught ourselves to code and turned it into an app.
Capo is built from that spreadsheet: every feature battle-tested in real games, every tweak born from real “this is actually annoying” moments.
 We’re building the app we wish we’d had from day one — and we’ll keep adding features as long as we’re still playing.

8. Social Proof / Quotes
Even if you only have a couple to start with, we can structure it now.
Layout
2–3 quote cards side-by-side on desktop; stacked on mobile.


Can be short lines + first name + group name.


Suggested animation
Cards slide in as you scroll, or auto-scroll carousel.


Sample copy (placeholder, you can swap later):
“We went from chasing people all week to just… not. The stats have made everyone weirdly invested.”
 — Dan, Tuesday Night Five, London
“Nobody argues about the teams anymore. Now they just argue about who’s the Grim Reaper.”
 — Ali, Friday 6pm game
“Feels like Fantasy Football but we’re actually on the pitch. The app has basically become part of the post-match chat.”
 — Josh, Barnet 5s

9. FAQs
Yes – you absolutely want these. They address friction and help SEO.
Layout
Accordion or collapsible FAQ list.


Suggested questions & answers:
## FAQs

**Do all my players have to download the app?**  
Not straight away. You can happily start as the only person using Capo – running your games, logging scores and tracking attendance – while you drop screenshots and stats into the group chat.  
Once people see their goals, streaks and AI-written profiles, they usually ask “what’s that app?” and join in. It’s built to spread naturally.

**Is Capo free?**  
Capo is free forever for organisers.  
If you use in-app payments, players pay a small fee per match and Capo handles the payouts – basically turning it into a football match payments app so you never chase money again.  
If you prefer to collect cash or bank transfers yourself, Capo stays 100% free for everyone.

**Is Capo only for 5-a-side?**  
Nope. Capo is built for small-sided football in general – 5-a-side, 6-a-side, 7-a-side, even 8s and 9s.  
The same organiser tools work for any format: RSVPs, waiting lists, AI-balanced teams, payments, stats and streaks. If you’re wondering how to organise a weekly five-a-side or seven-a-side game without chaos, this is exactly what it’s for.

**Isn’t WhatsApp enough?**  
WhatsApp is perfect for chat and banter – we use it too.  
It’s just not built to run football: no proper RSVPs, no logic for dropouts, no payments, no team balancing, no stats. That’s how you end up scrolling through 200 messages trying to work out who’s actually in.  
Keep the chat on WhatsApp. Let Capo be the football match organiser app that quietly handles the boring bits in the background.

**How is this different from Spond?**  
Spond is great for formal clubs, parents and big teams.  
Capo is built for mates and small-sided games – think your regular 5-a-side or 7-a-side. It mixes all the sensible organiser stuff (RSVPs, payments, attendance tracking) with the fun things you actually talk about: stats, streaks, AI profiles and fair teams. Less “school newsletter”, more “this is our kickabout”.

**Is it complicated to set up?**  
No. Most captains can organise their first game in a few minutes.  
Create your group, drop in your pitch, set your usual time and invite the squad. After that, Capo becomes your weekly football attendance tracker and team picker – you mostly just create new matches and hit “Finish” at full-time.

**What if someone doesn’t pay?**  
If you use in-app payments, players pay when they RSVP – so by the time you kick off, the match is already paid for. No awkward chasing, no IOUs, no fronting pitch money.  
Capo effectively becomes your football match payments app: it tracks who’s in, who’s paid and sends the money where it needs to go.

**Does Capo balance teams fairly?**  
Yes. Capo includes an AI team balancer built specifically for football. It looks at recent performances and form so your small-sided games feel fair – whether it’s 5-a-side, 6-a-side or 7-a-side.  
You can always nudge things manually if you fancy it, but most organisers just hit “Balance Teams” and get on with their night.

**Can Capo track goals, assists and streaks?**  
It can – that’s half the fun. Capo is a proper football stats app for casual players: it tracks goals, assists, appearances, win/loss, streaks, form and records over time.  
If you like the idea of fantasy-football-style stats but for your actual five-a-side performances, this is exactly that.

**Can I use Capo for leagues, or just one-off games?**  
You can do both. Capo works great for a single weekly kickabout, but it also doubles as a light football league tracking app – keeping a running table, points, streaks and history for your group across the season.

**What platforms is Capo on?**  
Capo is available on [iOS] and [Android] (and [web], if applicable).  
Captains can run everything from their phone at the side of the pitch – from RSVPs and team selection to final score and match report.
