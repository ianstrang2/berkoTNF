# CAPO  
## The 5-a-side football app your mates will obsess over.  
### And the game that finally runs itself.

Right now your club lives inside a chaotic WhatsApp thread, a captain's memory, and a spreadsheet from the Stone Age.

Capo is the casual football app that pulls everything into one clean, addictive, brilliantly simple football system —
**career stats for the players, zero admin for the organiser, fair teams every week.**

## FOR PLAYERS  
### Your football story, told properly.

Capo turns your casual football game into a proper mini-league — the kind people actually care about.  
Every match counts. Every stat matters. Every streak becomes lore. It's the football stats app for casual players — a proper 5-a-side stats tracker that finally treats your weeknight games like they matter.

### Your AI-written player biography  
Capo watches your performances — games, goals, wins, losses, scoring runs, attendance, form, seasons — and turns them into a living football narrative.  
It updates as you play. It remembers everything.  
It becomes the story of your career at the club.

### Streaks & form that actually feel like form  
Attendance runs. Unbeaten patches. Win streaks. Scoring streaks. Winless droughts.  
Capo tracks them all and shows your current heat with bold icons and simple visuals.  
You know exactly who’s on fire and who’s gone missing.

### Fantasy-style scoring — but from real football  
Every game feeds your season points: goals, assists, appearance points, win bonuses, clean sheet bonuses, streak multipliers and heavy-win rewards.  
Leaderboards shift every week. Suddenly everyone starts checking where they stand.

### Performance graphs that show your rise (or wobble)  
Your games, goals, minutes and points-per-game evolve across the season in clean, simple visuals.  
You can see your improvement — and everyone else’s.

### Chemistry that exposes the truth  
Capo reveals who you play best with, who you struggle with, and which combinations always deliver.  
Some partnerships just click. Some… don’t. Now you’ve got the data to prove it.

### Records, milestones & club legends  
Longest streaks, biggest scoring nights, heaviest defeats, milestone matches.  
Capo keeps the folklore straight.  
Your group stops being “just a chat” and becomes a club with real history.

### One-tap RSVPs  
Players tap IN or OUT.  
You instantly see your numbers — no scrolling, no guessing.

### Automatic waitlist  
If someone drops out, Capo fills the spot.  
You don’t lift a finger.

### Tiered invites (A/B/C groups)  
Your core players get invites first.  
Then it opens up if spaces remain.  
Your regulars feel valued. Your games fill faster.

### Payments handled upfront

You receive automatic payouts every match.  
No awkward chats. No IOUs. No fronting pitch money. Capo makes it effortless to collect football match payments every week.

Adjust the importance of things like pace, technique, goalscoring, teamwork and resilience.  
Use fixed ratings or let Capo lean on live form.  
The teams feel right before you even kick off.

### Balance Score with full breakdown  
When you generate teams, Capo shows a clear Balance Score and a breakdown across defence, midfield, attack, teamwork and resilience.  
If someone complains, you’ve got the evidence.

### Total control when you want it  
Drag players between teams. Re-run the balance. Lock the sides.  
Automatic when you want simple. Tweaker-friendly when you want control.
