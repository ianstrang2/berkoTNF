# iOS Pre-Production Checklist

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Complete these steps BEFORE submitting to App Store**

Date Created: October 17, 2025  
Purpose: Ensure iOS app meets Apple's requirements and security standards

---

## üö® Security Critical (App Store Will Reject)

### 1. Remove NSAppTransportSecurity from Info.plist

**Location:** `ios/App/App/Info.plist`

**What to remove:**
```xml
<!-- DELETE THIS ENTIRE SECTION -->
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

**Why:** 
- This allows insecure HTTP connections
- Only needed for dev server (`npm run ios:dev`)
- Apple rejects apps with this in production
- Production builds use HTTPS only (https://app.caposport.com)

**How to verify it's removed:**
```bash
# On Mac, search Info.plist
grep -i "NSAppTransportSecurity" ios/App/App/Info.plist

# Should return nothing (no matches)
```

**When to remove:** Right before creating your first App Store archive

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### 2. Remove Debug Logging

**Search for:** `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`

**Files to check:**
```bash
# Find all console statements
grep -r "console\." src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
```

**Why:** 
- Debug logs can expose sensitive data
- Affects performance
- Unprofessional in production

**What to do:**
- Remove debug logs
- Or wrap in environment checks: `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')`

---

### 3. Verify Privacy Policy

**Required before submission:**
- Privacy policy URL must be live
- Must explain data collection
- Must explain how you use Supabase/third-party services

**Where to add:**
- App Store Connect ‚Üí App Information ‚Üí Privacy Policy URL

**Example URL:** `https://capo.app/privacy`

---

### 4. Add Privacy Descriptions to Info.plist

**If your app uses these features, you MUST add descriptions:**

```xml
<!-- Camera (if you add photo features later) -->
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Capo needs camera access to upload profile photos.</string>

<!-- Photo Library (if you add photo features later) -->
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Capo needs photo access to select profile photos.</string>

<!-- Location (if you add location features later) -->
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Capo uses your location to find nearby matches.</string>
```

**Note:** Only add these if you actually use the features. Don't add unnecessary permissions.

---

## üé® App Store Assets
