## 🚀 Superadmin 3-Way View Selector

**Implementation Enhancement** (beyond original spec):

Superadmin header dropdown now offers:
1. **🏢 Platform View** → `/superadmin/tenants` (manage platform)
2. **⚙️ BerkoTNF - Admin View** → `/admin/matches` (manage as admin)
3. **👤 BerkoTNF - Player View** → `/` (test as player)

**Benefits**:
- Test all three perspectives from one account
- No need for multiple logins during development
- Tenant context switches automatically

---

## 📱 Capacitor Configuration

**App Details**:
- **Name**: Capo
- **Bundle ID**: com.caposport.capo
- **Domain**: caposport.com
- **Platforms**: Android (iOS pending MacBook)

**Dev Server Config**:
- URL: `http://10.0.2.2:3000` (Android emulator)
- Live reload enabled for fast iteration

**Status Bar** (Android):
- Background: Purple (#7e22ce) matching header
- Icons: Light (white)
- Safe-area padding applied

---

## 🚧 Phase 4: Final UI Polish (Remaining Work)

### Must Complete Before RSVP:

**1. Invite Link UI** (~15 mins):
- Add "📱 Club Invite Link" button to Players page header
- Modal displays invite URL with copy-to-clipboard button
- Uses existing `/api/admin/club-invite` endpoint

**2. Desktop/Web Profile Dropdown** (~25 mins):
- Person icon (👤) in header top-right
- Context-aware dropdown menu:
  - Players: Logout
  - Admins: Logout  
  - Admin-Players: View switching + Logout
  - Superadmins: 3-way view selector + Logout
- Replaces current standalone logout button
- Desktop and Mobile Web only (NOT Capacitor)

**3. Capacitor Admin Menu** (~15 mins):
- Add menu icon (⋮) for admin-only users in Capacitor
- Shows: Logout option
- Admin-players: Keep current centered button (no change)
- Players: No menu (no change)

**4. Enhanced Join Approval** (~15 mins):
- Add "Link to Existing Player" option in approval flow
- When approving, admin can choose: Create New OR Link to Existing
- Shows player's phone number in approval UI

**5. Player Table Indicators** (~10 mins):
- Add 📱 Phone column (green checkmark if set, gray dash if empty)
- Add 🔗 Claimed column (green if auth_user_id exists, gray if not)
- Hover tooltips show actual phone number

**6. Phone Change Auto-Unlink** (~5 mins):
- When admin updates player's phone number, clear `auth_user_id`
- Forces player to re-claim profile with new number
- Prevents auth/phone mismatch

**Total Remaining: ~95 minutes**

**Key Design Decision**: 
- **Capacitor logout**: Only for admins (via menu icon). Players don't need it (personal device).
- **Desktop/Web**: Profile dropdown for all roles (standard UX)
- **Scalability**: Superadmin menu works for 1-20 clubs; 50+ clubs upgrade to search modal

- 2FA for admin accounts
- Enhanced audit logging dashboard
- Biometric auth for mobile

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Minor sidebar flash** - Mostly resolved with layout persistence, occasional flash remains (acceptable)
2. **Profile refetch performance** - Optimized with caching, acceptable for MVP
3. **AdminModeToggle legacy** - Removed from new 3-way model

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Decisions Made

**Context-Aware Navigation**:
- Navigation based on **current URL**, not just user role
- Superadmin on `/` sees player nav (Dashboard, Upcoming, Table, Records)
- Superadmin on `/admin/*` sees admin nav (Matches, Players, Seasons, Setup)
- Superadmin on `/superadmin/*` sees superadmin nav (Tenants, System Info)

**Header Controls**:
- Superadmin: 3-way view selector
- Admin/Player: No toggle (navigate via URLs or bookmarks)
- Logout: Only on admin/superadmin pages (hidden on player pages for mobile prep)

**Mobile Preparation**:
- StatusBar plugin configured
- Safe-area CSS ready
- Header differentiation next step

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Supabase service role** required for app_metadata updates (not regular client)
2. **refreshSession()** can hang - use full page redirects instead
3. **Context-aware > Role-aware** - base UI on URL, not just permissions
4. **Layout persistence** critical for smooth navigation (Next.js best practice)
5. **Profile caching** prevents flicker but needs invalidation strategy
6. **Superadmin ≠ Admin** - different tenant scopes, can't easily link to players

**Authentication system is now complete!** Ready for RSVP system implementation.
