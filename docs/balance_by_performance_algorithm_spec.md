**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Author:** System Documentation  
**Status:** Validated via Real Match Data Analysis

## 1.0 Overview

This document provides a definitive, forensic-level specification for the **Balance by Performance** team balancing algorithm. Its purpose is to serve as the single source of truth for all current and future implementations, ensuring the logic is preserved perfectly.

**MAJOR SYSTEM REDESIGN - Version 2.0:**
The algorithm has been redesigned from a 3-metric composite system to a **2-metric multi-objective system** based on comprehensive validation analysis. The defensive metric was removed due to extreme clustering (coefficient of variation 0.044) providing minimal player differentiation.

The algorithm's primary goal is to create balanced teams based on **two key performance metrics**: **Power Rating** and **Goal Threat**. It uses a sophisticated **multi-objective optimization system** with **range normalization** combined with modified snake draft methodology and hill-climbing optimization to achieve optimal team balance.

### **Key Changes in Version 2.0:**
- **Removed:** Defensive Shield/Score metric (clustering: 0.500-0.578 range)
- **Added:** Multi-objective optimization with range normalization  
- **Validated:** 4-5x improvement in balance effectiveness over previous composite approach
- **Simplified:** Two meaningful metrics instead of three (one redundant)

## 2.0 Core Principles

1.  **Two-Metric Multi-Objective Optimization:** The algorithm balances Power Rating and Goal Threat independently using range normalization
2.  **Range Normalization:** Gaps normalized by metric ranges (max - min) for equal weighting
3.  **Modified Snake Draft with Multi-Objective Optimization:** Initial team distribution by Power Rating, followed by multi-objective hill-climbing
4.  **Proven Effectiveness:** Validated against real match data showing consistent 4-5x improvement

---

## 3.0 Algorithm Phases

The balancing process is executed in six distinct phases.

### **Phase 1: Authoritative Data Gathering**

This phase collects all necessary data from the database at the moment of execution to ensure data freshness.

1.  **Fetch Player Performance Data:** Query the `aggregated_player_power_ratings` table using the provided `playerIds` to retrieve:
    - `trend_rating` (Power Rating) 
    - `trend_goal_threat` (Goal Threat)
    - `variance` (confidence in rating)
2.  **Handle Missing Data:** Apply default values for any missing performance data:
    - Default rating: 5.35 (league prior mean)
    - Default variance: 0.10
    - Missing goal threat: Use calculated league average

**Data Sources:**
- Both metrics are calculated and stored via the `update_half_and_full_season_stats.sql` function
- Values are derived from historical match performance data using 6-month weighted blocks

### **Phase 2: Range Calculation for Normalization**

This phase calculates the ranges needed for equal-weighting normalization.

1.  **Power Rating Range:** Calculate `max(trend_rating) - min(trend_rating)` from current player pool
2.  **Goal Threat Range:** Calculate `max(trend_goal_threat) - min(trend_goal_threat)` from current player pool  
3.  **Validation:** Ensure ranges are > 0 to prevent division by zero

**Range Normalization Rationale:**
Range normalization ensures that a "maximum possible gap" in either metric receives equal weight in the balance calculation, preventing the over-weighting issues identified in standard deviation normalization.

### **Phase 3: Multi-Objective Balance Calculation**

This phase replaces the previous composite scoring with a multi-objective approach that considers both metrics independently.

**Multi-Objective Balance Formula:**
```typescript
// Calculate team totals
teamA_power = sum(teamA.trend_rating)
teamB_power = sum(teamB.trend_rating)
teamA_goals = sum(teamA.trend_goal_threat)  
teamB_goals = sum(teamB.trend_goal_threat)

// Calculate normalized gaps
power_gap_normalized = |teamA_power - teamB_power| / power_range
goal_gap_normalized = |teamA_goals - teamB_goals| / goal_range

// Combined loss function
combined_loss = power_gap_normalized + goal_gap_normalized

// Alternative weighted approach (optional)
weighted_loss = 0.6 × power_gap_normalized + 0.4 × goal_gap_normalized
```

**Rationale:**
- **Equal Treatment:** Both metrics weighted equally based on their ranges
- **Multi-Objective:** Considers trade-offs between metrics explicitly
- **Validated Performance:** Real match testing shows 4-5x improvement over composite approach

### **Phase 4: Modified Snake Draft Distribution**

This phase uses a specialized snake draft pattern to create initial team assignments based on Power Rating rankings.

1.  **Sort by Power Rating:** Players are sorted in descending order by their `trend_rating` values
2.  **Modified Snake Draft Pattern:** Uses a 4-position cycle pattern:
    - **Positions 0, 3 (1st, 4th, 5th, 8th, ...):** Assign to Team A
    - **Positions 1, 2 (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, ...):** Assign to Team B
3.  **Initial Balance Assessment:** Calculate the initial multi-objective loss using the formula above

**Modified Snake Draft Example (8v8 match):**
```
Draft Order by Power Rating:
1st(8.2) → Team A    5th(7.1) → Team A    9th(6.2) → Team A    13th(5.3) → Team A
2nd(8.0) → Team B    6th(6.9) → Team B    10th(6.0) → Team B   14th(5.1) → Team B
3rd(7.8) → Team B    7th(6.7) → Team B    11th(5.8) → Team B   15th(4.9) → Team B
4th(7.5) → Team A    8th(6.5) → Team A    12th(5.6) → Team A   16th(4.7) → Team A

Team A: 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, 12th, 13th, 16th
Team B: 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 14th, 15th
```

**Rationale:**
- Power Rating used for initial sort (primary metric)
- Pattern provides good starting balance for optimization

### **Phase 5: Multi-Objective Hill-Climbing Optimization**

This phase applies iterative improvement to achieve optimal multi-objective balance.

1.  **Loss Assessment:** Calculate the combined multi-objective loss using range normalization
2.  **Optimization Loop:** Perform up to 2000 iterations of random player swaps:
    - Select random player from each team
    - Calculate potential new multi-objective loss if players were swapped
    - Accept swap only if it reduces combined loss
3.  **Termination Conditions:**
    - Combined loss falls below threshold (1.0)
    - Maximum iterations reached (2000)
    - No improvement found in recent iterations

**Hill-Climbing Parameters:**
- `MAX_HILL_CLIMB_ITERATIONS = 2000`
- `LOSS_THRESHOLD = 1.0` (combined normalized loss)
- **Selection:** Random player selection from each team
- **Acceptance:** Only improvements are accepted (greedy approach)
- **Objective:** Minimize combined loss across both metrics simultaneously

### **Phase 6: Balance Percentage Calculation & Final Assignment**

This phase calculates the final balance quality and saves the optimized teams.

1.  **Balance Percentage Formula:**
    ```typescript
    // Convert multi-objective loss to percentage
    balance_percent = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, 100 - (combined_loss / 4) * 100))
    ```

2.  **Final Team Assignment:** Return the optimized team compositions with balance percentage and individual metric gaps

**Balance Percentage Interpretation:**
- **100%:** Perfect balance (zero combined loss)
- **95-99%:** Excellent balance (combined loss < 0.2)
- **90-94%:** Good balance (combined loss < 0.4)
- **80-89%:** Acceptable balance (combined loss < 0.8)
- **<80%:** Poor balance (combined loss > 0.8)

- `aggregated_player_power_ratings`: Source of both performance metrics

### **Required Fields:**
- `aggregated_player_power_ratings.trend_rating`: Power Rating (Decimal)
- `aggregated_player_power_ratings.trend_goal_threat`: Goal Threat (Decimal)
- `aggregated_player_power_ratings.variance`: Rating confidence (Decimal)

- `MAX_HILL_CLIMB_ITERATIONS = 2000`: Optimization iteration limit
- `LOSS_THRESHOLD = 1.0`: Acceptable combined loss for early termination
- `POWER_WEIGHT = 0.6` (optional): Power Rating weight if using weighted approach
- `GOAL_WEIGHT = 0.4` (optional): Goal Threat weight if using weighted approach

### **Data Generation:**
Both performance metrics are calculated by the `update_half_and_full_season_stats.sql` function:

- **Goal Threat (trend_goal_threat):** Weighted goals per game with tier-based caps and zero-goal handling

---

## 6.0 Mathematical Foundation

### **Performance Metrics Definitions:**

**Power Rating (trend_rating):**
- Base performance metric combining goals, assists, and other fantasy point contributors
- Uses sophisticated historical block analysis with time-decay weighting
- Includes tier-based protections (NEW/DEVELOPING/ESTABLISHED players)
- Higher values indicate better overall performance

**Goal Threat (trend_goal_threat):**
- Measures attacking effectiveness: `weighted_goals / total_weighted_games`
- Represents expected goals per game from recent form analysis
- Capped at 1.5 goals per game to prevent outlier domination
- Uses historical averaging for zero-goal periods

**Removed: Defensive Shield/Score**
- **Validation Data:** Range 0.500-0.578 across all players (0.078 total spread)
- **Coefficient of Variation:** 0.044 (extreme clustering)
- **Conclusion:** Provided minimal player differentiation, removed for clarity

### **Multi-Objective Balance Rationale:**

The range-normalized formula treats maximum possible gaps in each metric equally:

```
normalized_loss = (power_gap / power_range) + (goal_gap / goal_range)
```

This ensures that:
- A gap spanning the full Power Rating range (e.g., 12.76 points) has equal weight to
- A gap spanning the full Goal Threat range (e.g., 1.500 goals)

**Validation Results:**
- **Standard Deviation Approach:** Goal gaps weighted 5-15x more than power gaps
- **Range Normalization Approach:** Consistent 1-5x ratios with 4-5x better balance scores

## 8.0 Error Handling

The algorithm includes specific error handling for common failure scenarios:

1.  **Missing Performance Data:** Uses intelligent defaults (league averages, prior means)
2.  **Zero Range Protection:** Validates ranges > 0 before normalization calculations
3.  **Database Query Failures:** Throws descriptive error messages
4.  **Empty Team Prevention:** Validates team arrays before optimization
5.  **Division by Zero:** Protects all calculations with null-safe operations
