# LLM Player Profile Generation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for adding AI-generated player bios to enhance player profile screens. The system uses a **bulk context approach** - sending ALL aggregated league data (14 tables, 175+ columns) in a single LLM call to generate multiple rich, contextual profiles with comparative insights and league-wide awareness.

### Key Features
- **Bulk Context Processing**: Sends ALL aggregated data (14 tables, 175+ columns) in single LLM call
- **Dynamic League Inference**: Auto-computes league age, scale, and career stages from data (no hardcoded assumptions)
- **Comparative Insights**: LLM has full league context for rankings, percentiles, and relative achievements
- **Rich Narrative Generation**: Creates profiles with historical context, streak details, and teammate chemistry
- **Self-Adapting Scale Awareness**: Works for new leagues (emphasizes potential) and established leagues (deep history)
- **Ultra-Low Cost**: ~$0.009 per batch with optimized token control and Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite
- **Smart Generation Logic**: Rule-based system for when to generate/update/ignore profiles

## Data Sources & Player Context

The LLM receives ALL aggregated data from your 14 comprehensive tables (175+ total columns):

### Complete Aggregated Dataset
- **`aggregated_all_time_stats`** (18 cols): Career totals, win percentage, goals, clean sheets
- **`aggregated_half_season_stats`** (15 cols): Current period performance and historical blocks
- **`aggregated_hall_of_fame`** (5 cols): Record achievements and category rankings
- **`aggregated_match_report`** (21 cols): Match highlights, milestones, streaks, feat-breaking data
- **`aggregated_match_streaks`** (30 cols): Win/loss/attendance/scoring streaks with dates
- **`aggregated_performance_ratings`** (12 cols): EWMA power ratings, goal threat, percentiles
- **`aggregated_personal_bests`** (4 cols): Individual match and season records
- **`aggregated_player_power_ratings`** (14 cols): Historical power rating trends
- **`aggregated_player_profile_stats`** (24 cols): Complete player profiles with yearly stats
- **`aggregated_recent_performance`** (4 cols): Last 5 games analysis
- **`aggregated_records`** (3 cols): League-wide records and achievements
- **`aggregated_season_honours`** (4 cols): Annual winners and top performers
- **`aggregated_season_race_data`** (5 cols): Season progression and race standings
- **`aggregated_season_stats`** (16 cols): Season-by-season performance breakdowns

### Enhanced Content Intelligence (Bulk Context Benefits)
- **Comparative Rankings**: "Sarah's 67% win rate puts her in the top quartile of the league"
- **Historical Context**: "His 15-game win streak in 2019 was the 3rd longest in league history"
- **Relationship Insights**: "Known for strong chemistry with Mike (81% win rate together vs 52% apart)"
- **Performance Patterns**: "Always elevates his game against top opponents - averages 2.3 goals vs league leaders"
- **Milestone Recognition**: "That drought-breaking hat-trick after 23 scoreless games became instant legend"
- **League-Scale Perspective**: Understands what constitutes impressive performance in your specific league context

## Generation Logic & Rules

### Smart Generation Rules
The system uses a single flexible generation mode with configurable frequency (weekly/monthly via cron). Generation logic scans all players and applies these rules:

| Player Status | Has Profile? | Played in Last X Days? | Action | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|---------|-------|
| <5 games (any status) | No | Any | **Ignore** | Too few games for meaningful bio |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | No | Any | **Generate new bio** | Standard new player bio, adapted for league context |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | Yes | Yes | **Replace existing bio** | Update with recent performance, full history |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | Yes | No | **Ignore** | No recent changes; keep existing |
| Retired = Yes | No | Any | **Generate new bio (retro style)** | Retrospective career summary |
| Retired = Yes | Yes | Yes | **Replace existing bio (retro style)** | Retrospective if recent play (e.g., comeback) |
| Retired = Yes | Yes | No | **Ignore** | No updates for inactive retirees |
| Ringer = True (any other status) | Any | Any | **Ignore** | Exclude ringers entirely |

**"Played in Last X Days"** uses `last_match_date` from aggregates, with X configurable (default 30 days, amendable to 7 for weekly via code variable or app_settings).

### Tone & Style Configuration

Current implementation uses hardcoded **"Funny, Only-Positive"** tone. Future expansion options:

| Tone | Setting | Style Description |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Factual | Accurate | Straightforward stats, objective trends |
| Factual | Only-Positive | Stats-focused but upbeat |
| Funny | Accurate | Humorous banter, honest realities playfully |
| **Funny** | **Only-Positive** | **Light-hearted praise with jokes (hardcoded default)** |
| Banter | Accurate | Teasing/roast style, honest |
| Banter | Only-Positive | Fun ribbing without digs |

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Add profile storage to players table (if not already exists)
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_text TEXT;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Ensure required fields exist
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_retired BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_ringer BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Ensure last_match_date exists in aggregated_player_profile_stats
ALTER TABLE aggregated_player_profile_stats ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_match_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

### 2. SQL Function (`sql/export_league_data_for_profiles.sql`)

Enhanced data export function with dynamic league inference and token optimization:
- Exports complete league context with auto-calculated metrics (league_age_years, max_games_played, avg_games_per_year)
- Includes ALL 14 aggregated tables with 175+ columns of player data
- Token size control with LIMIT clauses on nested arrays (5 items max per nested table)
- Pagination support via offset/limit parameters for scalable processing
- Identifies target players needing profile generation based on rules
- Creates self-adapting JSON payload that works for any league size or age
- Enables data-driven narrative adaptation without hardcoded assumptions

${JSON.stringify(leagueData.all_players, null, 2)}

TARGET PLAYERS FOR PROFILE GENERATION:
${targetPlayers.map(p => `- ${p.name} (${p.action_type})`).join('\\n')}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate 2-3 paragraph profiles for ONLY the target players listed above. Use the complete league data to provide:

1. **Comparative insights** - rank them against other players (e.g., "top quartile", "3rd best streak in league history")
2. **Historical context** - reference league records, milestones, significant achievements  
3. **Relationship dynamics** - mention chemistry with specific teammates using actual win rate data
4. **Performance patterns** - identify unique trends, clutch moments, signature achievements
5. **Humorous flair** - keep it light-hearted and positive, use phrases like "making defenders weep with joy"

TONE: Funny, only-positive, banter style. Focus on strengths, achievements, and fun facts. NO negative comments.

LEAGUE SCALE INFERENCE: Analyze the league_context to determine the league's age (from date_range), total games, and scale. Adapt narratives accordingly—for example, in a new league with few games, treat early achievements as foundational; in an established league, emphasize long-term trends and records. Define career stages relative to the league's max games played (e.g., if max games is low, fewer games count as mid-career). Assume it's a casual weekly league unless data suggests otherwise. If league data is sparse (e.g., few games or short history), emphasize potential, fun early moments, and growth rather than historical rankings.

RETIRED PLAYERS: Use retrospective style celebrating their legacy and career highlights.

FORMAT: Return as JSON object with player names as keys:
{
  "PlayerName1": "Profile text here...",
  "PlayerName2": "Profile text here...",
  ...
}

```

**Key Features:**
- **Bulk Context Processing**: Sends ALL aggregated data (14 tables, 175+ columns) in single call
- **Pagination Support**: Handles large datasets with offset/limit parameters for scalability
- **Token Size Control**: LIMIT clauses on nested arrays prevent excessive token bloat
- **Comparative Intelligence**: LLM ranks players against full league dataset for contextual insights
- **Enhanced Response Parsing**: Robust parsing with name escaping for special characters
- **Complete League Awareness**: Full access to records, streaks, teammate chemistry, historical trends
- **Retry Logic**: 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff for API resilience  
- **Action-Based Generation**: Processes multiple players simultaneously based on rule-based actions
- **Hardcoded Tone**: "Funny, Only-Positive" with humor and league-specific banter
- **Production Ready**: Proper error handling, monitoring, and scalable architecture

### 4. Admin Interface Integration

Simplified admin panel integration:
- **Manual Trigger**: Single "Generate Player Profiles" button
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time generation status and results  
- **Configuration Display**: Shows current threshold (30 days) and batch limit
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track API usage and generation statistics

### 5. Player Profile Display Enhancement

Updated player profile screen (`PlayerProfile.component.tsx`) with:
- **Rich Bio Display**: Formatted multi-paragraph profiles
- **Generation Metadata**: Shows when profile was last updated
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains existing UI consistency
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful display when no bio exists

## Bulk Data Processing & LLM Input

### Enhanced LLM Intelligence
With complete league context, the LLM can generate insights like:
- **Comparative Rankings**: "Top quartile performer with 67% win rate"
- **Historical Context**: "3rd longest streak in 10-year league history"  
- **Relationship Analysis**: "Deadly combination with Mike - 81% win rate together"
- **Performance Patterns**: "Clutch performer who elevates in big games"

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Run schema migrations to add required fields to `players` and `aggregated_player_profile_stats` tables
2. Deploy SQL function `get_players_for_bio_generation.sql` to `/sql` directory
3. Test SQL function manually to validate rule logic and pagination

### Phase 2: Edge Function Development  
1. Create `generate-player-profiles` function following your established pattern
2. Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to Supabase secrets  
3. Replace `your-app.com` in HTTP-Referer with your actual domain
4. Configure `RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD` (30 for monthly, 7 for weekly)
5. Test with small player batch (2-3 players first) to validate prompt quality

### Phase 3: Cron Job Setup (Optional)
If you want dedicated cron scheduling instead of manual triggers, add this SQL file (`sql/schedule_player_bios_cron.sql`):

```sql
DO $$ 
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_cron') THEN
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
  END IF;
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_net') THEN
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_net;
  END IF;
END $$;

SELECT cron.unschedule('generate-player-bios');

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'generate-player-bios',
  '0 23 * * *', -- Daily at 23:00 UTC (adjust to weekly/monthly later)
  $$
  DO $$
  DECLARE
    offset INT := 0;
    total_processed INT := 0;
    batch_size INT := 50;
    response JSONB;
  BEGIN
    LOOP
      SELECT net.http_post(
        'https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate-player-profiles',
        jsonb_build_object('offset', offset)::jsonb,
        '{
          "Authorization": "Bearer your-service-role-key",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }'::jsonb
      ) INTO response;

      total_processed := total_processed + (response->>'processed')::INT;
      offset := offset + batch_size;

      -- Exit if no more players or error
      EXIT WHEN (response->>'status')::TEXT = 'No eligible players after filtering' OR (response->>'processed')::INT = 0;
    END LOOP;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Processed % players', total_processed;
  END $$;
  $$
);
```

### Phase 4: Integration with Existing Cron (Recommended)
1. Add `generate-player-profiles` to your existing stats update workflow
2. Test integration with overnight cron job
3. Enhance player profile display component to show generated bios

### Phase 5: Testing & Monitoring
**Testing Steps:**
1. **Test SQL Export**: Run `SELECT export_league_data_for_profiles(30)` and check token size (aim <100K)
2. **Validate Data Quality**: Ensure all 14 aggregated tables are included with proper joins and LIMIT controls
3. **Test Diverse Players**: Generate profiles for 3 players - newbie (5 games), veteran (100+ games), retired (50+ games)
4. **Verify Comparative Insights**: Check for phrases like "top quartile", "3rd longest streak in league history"
5. **Validate Humor & Tone**: Look for humor phrases like "weeping with joy" and positive achievements
6. **Test Retrospective Style**: Ensure retired players get career celebration narrative
7. **Test Weekly Behavior**: Run with `RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 7` to validate weekly generation logic
8. **Check Cost**: Monitor OpenRouter dashboard for actual token usage post-test
9. **Test Pagination**: Verify offset/limit parameters work correctly for large datasets

**Monitoring:**
1. Deploy via your existing script workflow
2. Monitor generation results and API costs
3. Validate rule-based logic is working correctly (retired vs active handling)
4. Check logs for retry attempts and error handling

## Cost Analysis & Optimization

### Expected Costs (Enhanced Bulk Context with Token Control)
- **Input Tokens**: ~50K tokens (optimized league data with LIMIT controls) × $0.10/M = **$0.005 per batch**
- **Output Tokens**: ~10K tokens (batch of profiles) × $0.40/M = **$0.004 per batch**  
- **Total Cost**: **~$0.009 per batch** (even more efficient!)
- **Monthly Budget**: **<$0.40/month** for weekly generation or **<$0.12/month** for monthly
- **Initial Backfill**: **~$0.009** for all existing eligible players

### Comparison vs Individual Approach
- **Old approach**: 27 × $0.00014 = **$0.0038** but with minimal context
- **New approach**: **$0.01** but with complete league intelligence and comparative insights
- **Value**: **~3x cost for 20x richer profiles** - incredible ROI!

### Cost Controls
- **Targeted Generation**: Only active or new players
- **Batch Limiting**: Max 50 players per run
- **Skip Logic**: Avoids regenerating unchanged profiles
- **Efficient Prompts**: Optimized token usage

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Robust Error Management
- **API Failures**: Graceful handling of LLM service outages
- **Database Logging**: Track failures in existing `log_errors` table
- **Partial Success**: Continue processing despite individual player failures
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in resilience for transient failures

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Generation Statistics**: Track success/failure rates
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage trends
- **Quality Assurance**: Admin review capabilities for generated content

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Multilingual Support**: Generate profiles in different languages
- **Style Variations**: Expand beyond current tone options
- **Performance Analytics**: A/B test different prompt strategies
- **User Feedback**: Allow players to request profile regeneration

## Integration with Existing Cron Job

### Recommended Integration
Add `generate-player-profiles` to your existing `FUNCTIONS_TO_CALL` array in `src/app/api/admin/trigger-stats-update/route.ts`:

```typescript
const FUNCTIONS_TO_CALL: Array<{ name: string; tag?: string; tags?: string[] }> = [
  // ... existing functions ...
  { name: 'generate-player-profiles', tag: CACHE_TAGS.PLAYER_PROFILE }
];
```

### Optimal Flow Sequence
1. **Overnight cron triggers stats update** (existing)
2. **All aggregation functions run** (existing) 
3. **Profile generation runs with fresh data** (new - runs last)
4. **Cache invalidation** (existing)

### Configuration Options
- **Weekly Generation**: Set `RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 7` in Edge Function
- **Monthly Generation**: Set `RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 30` (default)  
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via admin interface anytime

This ensures profiles are generated with the most current player statistics, using the rule-based logic to determine which players need new/updated profiles.
