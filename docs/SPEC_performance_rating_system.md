### Implementation Status:
- **Database**: ‚úÖ `aggregated_performance_ratings` table with live EWMA data
- **Calculation**: ‚úÖ `update_power_ratings()` function using 2-year half-life EWMA
- **Edge Function**: ‚úÖ Successfully generating EWMA performance ratings
- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Admin UI integrated into `/admin/info` with soft-ui styling

---

## Overview
The Performance Rating System provides player performance metrics for both team balancing and player statistics display. **NEW**: Now uses exponentially weighted moving averages for smooth recency weighting instead of period-based blocks.

## Core Metrics (EWMA System)

### Power Rating
- **Method**: Exponentially weighted fantasy points per weighted game
- **Half-life**: 730 days (2 years) - configurable in `app_config`
- **Bayesian Shrinkage**: New players shrunk toward league average (5-game prior weight)
- **Usage**: Raw values for team balancing, percentiles for display

### Goal Threat  
- **Method**: Exponentially weighted goals per weighted game
- **Calculation**: Same EWMA methodology as power rating
- **Bayesian Shrinkage**: Applied consistently with power rating
- **Usage**: Raw values for team balancing, percentiles for display

### Participation Rate
- **Method**: Weighted games played / weighted games available √ó 100
- **Availability**: Counted from player's first match date
- **Display**: Percentage with percentile ranking for qualified players

## Qualification System
- **Threshold**: 5 weighted games (configurable in `app_config`)
- **Display Logic**: Only qualified players get percentile rankings (unqualified default to 50th percentile)
- **Team Balancing**: Uses all players (with Bayesian defaults for unqualified)  
- **Ringer Handling**: Uses EWMA values if qualified, otherwise defaults
- **Universal Coverage**: ALL non-retired players get EWMA ratings through Bayesian shrinkage



## EWMA Analysis
- Single exponentially weighted value per metric per player
- No trend projections needed - EWMA inherently recency-weighted
- Current ratings represent both current skill and form
- Values used directly for team balancing and display

## Data Storage

### EWMA Performance Ratings
```typescript
interface EWMAPerformanceRating {
  player_id: number;
  power_rating: number;
  goal_threat: number;
  participation: number;
  weighted_played: number;
  weighted_available: number;
  is_qualified: boolean;
  power_percentile: number;
  goal_percentile: number;
  participation_percentile: number;
  first_match_date: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

## Percentile Calculation
- Calculated across all qualified players in the league
- Uses PERCENT_RANK for true relative percentiles that reflect actual league standings
- Formula: `ROUND((PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY metric ASC) * 100)::numeric, 1)`
- Defaults to 50 for unqualified players or when all values are equal
- Only calculated after raw EWMA values are finalized
- **Fixed Issue**: Previously used `width_bucket()` which gave bucket positions rather than true percentile rankings

## Edge Cases

### New Players
- Track raw stats immediately
- Use raw data for team balancing
- Don't show ratings until qualification threshold met
- Clear qualification status display

### Missing Periods
- Handle gaps in participation
- Use available periods for trends
- Clear status indication

## Validation Tools
- Admin data view at `/admin/info` (EWMA Performance Ratings section)
- Shows EWMA power rating, goal threat, and participation with percentiles
- Displays system metadata (weighted games, qualification status, half-life)
- Helps validate EWMA calculation correctness

## Implementation Notes
- All calculations performed in database
- Single SQL function handles all updates
- No temporary tables - pure CTE pipeline
- Proper error handling for edge cases
- Cache invalidation on updates

### Execution Dependencies
- **Independent**: `update_power_ratings()` now operates independently using `aggregated_performance_ratings` table
- **Clean Architecture**: EWMA system uses dedicated table, avoiding data conflicts with basic stats functions
- **No Order Dependencies**: Can run before or after other aggregation functions

## Recent Fixes (v5.1)

### SQL Function Corrections
- **Fixed Window Function Issue**: Separated regression calculation (`w_agg`) from latest value retrieval (`w_first`) to ensure proper statistical calculations
- **Fixed CTE Execution**: Added reference to `upsert_trends` CTE in final INSERT to ensure trend calculations execute
- **Deterministic Results**: Added explicit ORDER BY to `trend_final` CTE for consistent results

### API Improvements  
- **Simplified Trends API**: Updated `/api/player/trends/[playerId]` to return EWMA data directly
- **Debugging Support**: Enhanced admin data view at `/admin/info` to display EWMA ratings and percentiles

### Validation Status
- ‚úÖ EWMA calculations operational for all qualified players
- ‚úÖ Percentile rankings accurate and stable
- ‚úÖ Admin debugging interface functional for EWMA validation

## Ringer Data Strategy (v5.4)

### Problem: Inconsistent Ringer Handling
- **Profile 404s**: Ringers with substantial match history (Jude McKay: 18 matches) couldn't access player profiles
- **Debug Tool Gaps**: Admin debugging page excluded ringers, preventing power rating validation
- **Data Fragmentation**: Ringers had power ratings but missing profile/historical data
- **Team Balancing**: Some ringers (Jude: 18 matches, Finn: 7 matches) have enough data for meaningful balance calculations

### Solution: Data Layer vs Presentation Layer Strategy
**Data Layer (SQL Functions)**: Generate data for all non-retired players (including ringers)
- ‚úÖ `update_half_and_full_season_stats.sql`: Include ringers (`WHERE p.is_retired = false`)
- ‚úÖ `update_aggregated_player_profile_stats.sql`: Include ringers (`WHERE p.is_retired = false`)
- ‚úÖ `update_aggregated_all_time_stats.sql`: Include ringers (`WHERE p.is_retired = false`)
- ‚ùå **Keep exclusions**: `aggregated_season_race_data`, `aggregated_season_honours_and_records`, `aggregated_hall_of_fame` (competition integrity)

**Presentation Layer (Frontend)**: Filter display based on context
- **Include Ringers**: Admin tools, debugging pages, player profiles, team balancing
- **Exclude Ringers**: Public leaderboards, season races, awards/honors, records

### Benefits
- **üîß Robust Debugging**: Admin tools work for all players with data
- **üö´ Eliminated 404s**: Player profiles accessible for all players
- **‚öñÔ∏è Flexible Display**: Same data, context-appropriate views
- **üèÜ Competition Integrity**: Awards/races remain fair for regular players
- **üìä Complete Analysis**: Backend has full dataset for team balancing

### API Improvements
- **Trends API**: Enhanced to handle missing `historical_blocks` gracefully for ringers
- **Admin Players API**: Added retirement filter to exclude retired players from debugging dropdown
- **Debug Page**: Enhanced with special ringer display showing current trend values in card format
- **Team Balancing**: Ringers contribute meaningful calculated values (Jude: trend_rating=3, trend_goal_threat=1.85) instead of zeros

### Critical Fix: Ringer Data Anomalies (v5.4.1)
- **Root Cause**: Including ringers in percentile calculations caused data anomalies that disrupted window functions
- **Symptom**: All players (including regular players) had empty `historical_blocks = []`
- **Solution**: Hybrid approach - include ringers in basic stats calculation but exclude from historical blocks generation
- **Result**: Regular players get full data, ringers get real trend values but empty historical blocks (preventing 404s)

### Admin Interface Improvements (v5.4.2)
- **Retired Player Filter**: Updated `/api/admin/players` to exclude retired players from debugging dropdown (`WHERE is_retired = false`)
- **Ringer Trend Calculation**: Modified power ratings function to include ringers in trend calculation but exclude from historical blocks
- **Hybrid Approach**: Ringers get real calculated trend values (for team balancing) but empty historical blocks (to avoid percentile issues)
- **Enhanced Ringer Display**: Added special debugging view for ringers showing current trend values in card format
- **Validated Results**: Jude McKay (ringer) now shows trend_rating=3, trend_goal_threat=1.85, power_rating_percentile=34, goal_threat_percentile=100

### Final Implementation Status (v5.4.4)
- ‚úÖ **Regular Players**: Full historical blocks + trend data with accurate percentile rankings
- ‚úÖ **Ringers**: Real trend values displayed in special card layout with amber warning indicator
- ‚úÖ **Retired Players**: Completely excluded from debugging interface
- ‚úÖ **Team Balancing**: Ringers now contribute meaningful data instead of zeros
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: Historical blocks remain stable through proper execution order
- ‚úÖ **Percentile Accuracy**: True rank-based percentiles using PERCENT_RANK() instead of width_bucket()
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issue**: Fragile execution order dependency between update functions (architectural fix needed)

## Critical Fixes (v5.4.4)

### Percentile Calculation Accuracy Fix
- **Issue**: `width_bucket()` approach gave bucket positions, not actual league percentile rankings
- **Symptom**: Players with excellent performance (e.g., 7th out of 28) showed middle percentiles (47th)
- **Root Cause**: `width_bucket()` divides value range into buckets, doesn't reflect rank-based standings
- **Fix**: Replaced with `PERCENT_RANK()` for true rank-based percentiles
- **Formula**: `ROUND((PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY metric ASC) * 100)::numeric, 1)`
- **Result**: 7th place out of 28 players now correctly shows ~78th percentile instead of 47th
- **Impact**: Both historical period percentiles AND trend percentiles now accurately reflect league standings

### Function Execution Order Dependency
- **Issue**: `update_half_and_full_season_stats()` deletes all `aggregated_half_season_stats` data, including `historical_blocks` populated by `update_power_ratings()`
- **Symptom**: Players showing as "ringers" with empty historical data after stats updates
- **Root Cause**: `DELETE FROM aggregated_half_season_stats WHERE TRUE;` removes complex analytics data
- **Temporary Fix**: Moved `call-update-power-ratings` to run LAST in execution order
- **Location**: `src/app/api/admin/trigger-stats-update/route.ts` - reordered `FUNCTIONS_TO_CALL` array
- **Future**: Requires architectural separation of basic stats vs complex analytics data

## Critical Fixes (v5.2)

### Goal Threat Calculation Bug
- **Issue**: Function was counting "games with goals" instead of "total goals scored"
- **Root Cause**: `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE COALESCE(pm.goals,0) > 0)` in data collection
- **Fix**: Changed to `SUM(COALESCE(pm.goals,0))` to get actual goal totals
- **Impact**: Top scorers like Pete Hay now show correct percentiles (90th+ instead of 65th)

### Trend Calculation Regression Bug  
- **Issue**: Trends were mathematically impossible (Pete Hay: 1.273 recent ‚Üí 0.693 trend)
- **Root Cause**: Using epoch timestamps as X-variable in `REGR_SLOPE` caused:
  - Massive numbers (billions) leading to precision loss
  - Uneven weighting of periods due to time gaps
  - Wrong projection multiplier (15,778,463 seconds ‚âà 6 months)
- **Fix**: Sequential period indexing approach
  - Added `period_seq` CTE with `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY period_end ASC)` 
  - Changed regression to use period sequence (1, 2, 3...) as X-variable
  - Set projection multiplier to 1 (one period ahead)
  - Separated trend pipeline from historical blocks pipeline

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Regression Formula**: `latest_value + slope √ó 1` where slope uses period sequence
- **Benefits**: 
  - Even weighting of all qualified periods regardless of time gaps
  - Avoids floating-point precision issues with large numbers
  - Intuitive "per-period" trend units
  - Realistic projections close to recent performance

### Updated Validation Status  
- ‚úÖ Goal threat calculations now accurate (Pete Hay: 1.423 trend vs 1.273 recent)
- ‚úÖ Trend projections mathematically sound across all metrics
- ‚úÖ Historical blocks and trends work independently
- ‚úÖ Top performers show appropriate percentiles (90th+ for league leaders)

## Trend Capping Enhancement (v5.3)

### The Problem: Uncapped Linear Regression
- **Linear extrapolation risks**: Small samples can produce unrealistic projections
- **Example**: Tarik's 42.5 power rating could spike to 60+ with one more strong period
- **Negative values**: James Shuker's -0.135 power rating is impossible (points can't be negative)
- **Percentile distortion**: Extreme outliers skew rankings, making stable players feel undervalued

### The Solution: Historical Bounds Capping
```sql
-- Global min/max across all qualified periods
historical_dist AS (
    SELECT 
        MIN(power_rating) AS min_power,
        MAX(power_rating) AS max_power,
        MIN(goal_threat) AS min_threat,
        MAX(goal_threat) AS max_threat,
        MIN(participation) AS min_part,
        MAX(participation) AS max_part
    FROM period_rates
    WHERE power_rating IS NOT NULL
),

-- Apply caps post-regression
trend_final AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (tc.player_id)
        tc.player_id,
        GREATEST(hd.min_power, LEAST(hd.max_power, tc.latest_rating + tc.rating_slope * 1)) AS trend_rating,
        GREATEST(hd.min_threat, LEAST(hd.max_threat, tc.latest_threat + tc.threat_slope * 1)) AS trend_goal_threat,
        GREATEST(hd.min_part, LEAST(hd.max_part, tc.latest_part + tc.part_slope * 1)) AS trend_participation
    FROM trend_core tc
    CROSS JOIN historical_dist hd
    ORDER BY tc.player_id
)
```

### Benefits
- **Realistic projections**: Trends anchored to empirically observed league performance
- **Robust percentiles**: Eliminates extreme outlier inflation
- **User trust**: Projections feel grounded in historical feasibility
- **Industry standard**: Similar to ESPN fantasy, MLB PECOTA, NFL projections

### Mathematical Foundation
- **Formula**: `capped_trend = GREATEST(historical_min, LEAST(historical_max, uncapped_trend))`
- **Global bounds**: Uses league-wide min/max across all players and periods
- **Preserves regression**: Caps applied post-calculation, maintaining slope accuracy
- **Edge case handling**: Single-period players default to latest value (already bounded)
