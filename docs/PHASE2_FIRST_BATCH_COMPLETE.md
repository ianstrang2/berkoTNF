## 🔧 Changes Made

### Pattern Applied

**Before:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const tenantId = await getTenantFromRequest(request);
    await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', ${tenantId}, false)`;
    const data = await prisma.table.findMany({ where: { tenant_id: tenantId } });
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    return handleTenantError(error);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withTenantContext(request, async (tenantId) => {
    // Middleware automatically sets RLS context ✅
    const data = await prisma.table.findMany({ where: { tenant_id: tenantId } });
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  }).catch(handleTenantError);
}
```

### Key Changes

- ✅ Removed manual `getTenantFromRequest()` calls
- ✅ Removed manual `prisma.$executeRaw` RLS setup
- ✅ Wrapped handlers with `withTenantContext`
- ✅ Kept explicit `where: { tenant_id }` filters (defense-in-depth!)
- ✅ Updated error handling to `.catch(handleTenantError)`

---

## 🧪 Testing Required BEFORE Continuing

**Before updating the remaining 41 routes, test these 7:**

### Test 1: Restart Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected:**
- Server starts without errors
- Middleware logs: `[PRISMA] Client initialized with RLS middleware`

---

### Test 2: Check Middleware Logs

Make requests to the updated routes and check logs:

```bash
# Check logs in terminal
npm run dev

# In browser, navigate to:
- /admin/players (triggers /api/admin/players)
- /admin/matches (triggers /api/upcoming)
- / or /player/dashboard (triggers /api/players, /api/matchReport)
```

**Expected in logs:**
```
[PRISMA_MIDDLEWARE] Set RLS context: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

---

### Test 3: Verify Data Loads Correctly

**As BerkoTNF admin (`07949251277`):**

1. Navigate to `/admin/players`
   - Should see 82 players ✅
   - No errors in console ✅

2. Navigate to `/` (dashboard)
   - Should see match report ✅
   - Should see all-time stats ✅

3. Navigate to `/admin/seasons`
   - Should see seasons list ✅
   - Try creating a season ✅

**As Poo Wanderers (`07949222222`):**

1. Navigate to available pages
   - Should see only Poo Wanderers data ✅
   - Should NOT see any BerkoTNF data ✅

---

### Test 4: Verify No Errors

**Check browser console for:**
- ❌ No "permission denied" errors
- ❌ No "RLS may block query" warnings (should be gone now!)
- ❌ No 500 errors

**Check terminal logs for:**
- ✅ Middleware setting context successfully
- ✅ Queries returning data
- ❌ No database errors

---

## 📊 Progress

**Updated:** 7/48 (15%)  
**Remaining:** 41 routes  
**Linter Errors:** None ✅

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test First (Recommended) ⭐

1. **Test the 7 updated routes thoroughly**
2. Verify middleware works correctly
3. Check both tenants
4. If all good → Continue with remaining 41 routes
5. If issues → Fix before continuing

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes testing

---

### Option 2: Continue Updating (Riskier)

1. Update all remaining 41 routes now
2. Test everything at the end
3. More risk of cascading issues
4. Harder to isolate problems

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours updating + testing

---

## ✅ Test Checklist

Before continuing with remaining routes:

- [ ] Dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Middleware logs appear for all 7 routes
- [ ] BerkoTNF admin can access all features
- [ ] Poo Wanderers sees only their data
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] No "RLS may block" warnings
- [ ] Admin sidebar shows correctly (Matches, Players, Seasons, Setup)
- [ ] Player pages load correctly (Dashboard, Upcoming, Table, Records)

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**PAUSE HERE AND TEST** 🛑

**Why:**
1. 7 routes cover most critical user flows
2. Early testing catches issues before updating all 48
3. Easier to debug with fewer changed files
4. Can validate the pattern before mass update
5. 15 minutes of testing saves hours of debugging

**After tests pass:**
- Update remaining 41 routes with confidence
- Same pattern proven to work
- Lower risk of issues

**Status:** 7/48 routes updated ✅  
**Linter:** No errors ✅  
**Next:** Test these 7 routes, then continue ⭐
