# LLM Player Profile Generation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for adding AI-generated player bios to enhance player profile screens. The system uses an **individual processing with league context approach** - sending league context data plus detailed individual player data per call to generate rich, contextual profiles with comparative insights and league-wide awareness.

**🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETED AND OPERATIONAL**
- ✅ **Fully Deployed**: All components are implemented and working in production
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Complete management interface in `/admin/info` page
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Player profiles display AI-generated bios seamlessly  
- ✅ **Automated Generation**: Weekly cron job generates profiles for active players
- ✅ **Manual Control**: Admin can trigger updates and resets via dashboard

### Key Features
- **Individual Processing with League Context**: Optimized approach sending league context + individual player data per call
- **Dynamic League Inference**: Auto-computes league age, scale, and career stages from data (no hardcoded assumptions)  
- **Dynamic Profile Length**: Automatically scales narrative depth based on matches played (50-100 words for <25 games, scaling up to 350-450 words for 200+ games)
- **Enhanced Career Retrospective**: Comprehensive career arcs for veterans with season-by-season progression, highs/lows, and milestone moments
- **Comparative Insights**: League records, season honors, and percentile rankings provide rich comparative context
- **Rich Narrative Generation**: Creates profiles with historical context, streak details, and teammate chemistry
- **Self-Adapting Scale Awareness**: Works for new leagues (emphasizes potential) and established leagues (deep history)
- **Cost Efficient**: ~$0.012 per batch with individual processing (~15KB prompts)
- **Smart Generation Logic**: Rule-based system for when to generate/update/ignore profiles  
- **No Data Attribution Issues**: Individual processing eliminates cross-player data contamination
- **Robust Admin Interface**: Complete dashboard for profile management, statistics, and manual controls

### 🔧 Configuration Status - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **OpenRouter API Key**: Configured in Supabase secrets  
- ✅ **Domain Configuration**: `https://caposport.com` 
- ✅ **Model Selected**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
- ✅ **Version Control**: All configuration in editable code files (`vercel.json`, `.env.local`, `/api` routes)
- ✅ **Consistency**: Follows existing `trigger-stats-update` pattern exactly
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Profile fields deployed (`profile_text`, `profile_generated_at`)
- ✅ **Vercel Cron**: Weekly generation schedule active (Sundays 11 PM UTC)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Complete management interface operational

### 📋 Implementation Summary - COMPLETED FILES
**New Files Created:**
- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles/route.ts` - API route for manual/cron triggers
- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/player-profile-metadata/route.ts` - Profile statistics API
- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/reset-player-profiles/route.ts` - Reset and regenerate all profiles
- ✅ `sql/export_league_data_for_profiles.sql` - Target player identification function
- ✅ `sql/export_individual_player_for_profile.sql` - Individual player + league context export
- ✅ `supabase/functions/generate-player-profiles/index.ts` - Individual processing Edge Function

**Configuration Updates:**
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Weekly cron entry for profile generation (Sundays 11 PM)
- ✅ Environment: `PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD=7` (7-day threshold for updates)
- ✅ Prisma schema: Added `profile_text` and `profile_generated_at` to players model

**UI Integration:**
- ✅ `src/components/player/PlayerProfile.component.tsx` - Displays AI bios between power ratings and streaks
- ✅ `src/app/admin/info/page.tsx` - Complete admin dashboard with statistics and controls  
- ✅ `src/app/api/playerprofile/route.ts` - Updated to return profile data

**No Hidden Configs:** Everything is in version-controlled code files, no pg_cron or database-stored configuration.

## Key Architecture Changes from Original Plan

### Individual Processing (IMPLEMENTED)
The system was built using **individual processing with league context** rather than the originally planned bulk approach:

**Why Individual Processing:**
- **Prompt Size Issue**: Bulk approach generated 685KB prompts causing HTTP 400 errors
- **Better Data Attribution**: Eliminates cross-player data contamination  
- **Maintained Context**: Still provides league records, season honors, and comparative rankings
- **Cost Efficient**: ~$0.012 per batch (only 3x cost of minimal approach) for 90% of comparative benefits

**Technical Implementation:**
- Each player processed separately with full league context (~15KB prompts)
- League context includes records, honors, and comparative statistics
- Target player receives complete individual data (14 aggregated tables)
- Maintains rich narrative capability with percentile rankings and historical context

### Admin Dashboard (NEW)
Comprehensive management interface added to `/admin/info` page:

**Features:**
- **Profile Statistics**: Shows generation status for all players
- **Manual Controls**: "Update Profiles" and "Reset & Regenerate" buttons  
- **Real-time Status**: Displays last generation timestamps
- **Progress Tracking**: Success/failure rates and generation results
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing admin interface

**Usage:**
- View which players have profiles and when they were last updated
- Manually trigger profile generation for active players
- Reset all profiles and regenerate from scratch  
- Monitor generation health and troubleshoot issues

## Data Sources & Player Context

The LLM receives ALL aggregated data from your 14 comprehensive tables (175+ total columns):

### Complete Aggregated Dataset
- **`aggregated_all_time_stats`** (18 cols): Career totals, win percentage, goals, clean sheets
- **`aggregated_half_season_stats`** (15 cols): Current period performance and historical blocks
- **`aggregated_hall_of_fame`** (5 cols): Record achievements and category rankings
- **`aggregated_match_report`** (21 cols): Match highlights, milestones, streaks, feat-breaking data
- **`aggregated_match_streaks`** (30 cols): Win/loss/attendance/scoring streaks with dates
- **`aggregated_performance_ratings`** (12 cols): EWMA power ratings, goal threat, percentiles
- **`aggregated_personal_bests`** (4 cols): Individual match and season records
- **`aggregated_player_power_ratings`** (14 cols): Historical power rating trends
- **`aggregated_player_profile_stats`** (24 cols): Complete player profiles with yearly stats
- **`aggregated_recent_performance`** (4 cols): Last 5 games analysis
- **`aggregated_records`** (3 cols): League-wide records and achievements
- **`aggregated_season_honours`** (4 cols): Annual winners and top performers
- **`aggregated_season_race_data`** (5 cols): Season progression and race standings
- **`aggregated_season_stats`** (16 cols): Season-by-season performance breakdowns

### Enhanced Content Intelligence (Bulk Context Benefits)
- **Comparative Rankings**: "Sarah's 67% win rate puts her in the top quartile of the league"
- **Historical Context**: "His 15-game win streak in 2019 was the 3rd longest in league history"
- **Relationship Insights**: "Known for strong chemistry with Mike (81% win rate together vs 52% apart)"
- **Performance Patterns**: "Always elevates his game against top opponents - averages 2.3 goals vs league leaders"
- **Milestone Recognition**: "That drought-breaking hat-trick after 23 scoreless games became instant legend"
- **League-Scale Perspective**: Understands what constitutes impressive performance in your specific league context

## Generation Logic & Rules

### Smart Generation Rules
The system uses a single flexible generation mode with configurable frequency (weekly/monthly via cron). Generation logic scans all players and applies these rules:

| Player Status | Has Profile? | Played in Last X Days? | Action | Notes |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|---------|-------|
| <5 games (any status) | No | Any | **Ignore** | Too few games for meaningful bio |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | No | Any | **Generate new bio** | Standard new player bio, adapted for league context |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | Yes | Yes | **Replace existing bio** | Update with recent performance, full history |
| 5+ games, Not Retired, Not Ringer | Yes | No | **Ignore** | No recent changes; keep existing |
| Retired = Yes | No | Any | **Generate new bio (retro style)** | Retrospective career summary |
| Retired = Yes | Yes | Yes | **Replace existing bio (retro style)** | Retrospective if recent play (e.g., comeback) |
| Retired = Yes | Yes | No | **Ignore** | No updates for inactive retirees |
| Ringer = True (any other status) | Any | Any | **Ignore** | Exclude ringers entirely |

**"Played in Last X Days"** uses `last_match_date` from aggregates, with X configurable (default 30 days, amendable to 7 for weekly via code variable or app_settings).

### Tone & Style Configuration

Current implementation uses **"Funny"** tone with light-hearted banter. Updated configuration:

| Tone | Setting | Style Description |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Factual | Accurate | Straightforward stats, objective trends |
| Factual | Only-Positive | Stats-focused but upbeat |
| **Funny** | **Honest-Positive** | **Humorous banter with honest mentions of lows (current implementation)** |
| Funny | Only-Positive | Light-hearted praise with jokes (previous version) |
| Banter | Accurate | Teasing/roast style, honest |
| Banter | Only-Positive | Fun ribbing without digs |

**Current Style**: Funny with light-hearted banter. Allows honest mentions of lows (slumps, droughts, tough periods) but frames them humorously and positively overall. Keeps tone fun, engaging, and league-specific without being harsh or negative.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Add profile storage to players table (if not already exists)
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_text TEXT;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_generated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Ensure required fields exist
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_retired BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE players ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_ringer BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Note: last_match_date is calculated on-the-fly in the export function
-- No additional column needed - calculated dynamically from matches data
```

### 2. SQL Function (`sql/export_league_data_for_profiles.sql`)

Enhanced data export function with dynamic league inference and token optimization:
- Exports complete league context with auto-calculated metrics (league_age_years, max_games_played, avg_games_per_year)
- Includes ALL 14 aggregated tables with 175+ columns of player data
- Token size control with LIMIT clauses on nested arrays (5 items max per nested table)
- Pagination support via offset/limit parameters for scalable processing
- Identifies target players needing profile generation based on rules
- Creates self-adapting JSON payload that works for any league size or age
- Enables data-driven narrative adaptation without hardcoded assumptions

### 3. API Route (`src/app/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles/route.ts`)

**Following your existing pattern with `trigger-stats-update` for consistency:**

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

// Main profile generation logic that can be called by both GET (cron) and POST (manual)
async function triggerProfileGeneration() {
  const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL;
  const supabaseServiceRoleKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;
  const recentDaysThreshold = parseInt(process.env.PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD || '7');

  if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseServiceRoleKey) {
    console.error('Supabase URL or Service Role Key is missing.');
    return NextResponse.json({ success: false, error: 'Server configuration error' }, { status: 500 });
  }

  const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseServiceRoleKey);
  console.log(`🎭 Starting profile generation with ${recentDaysThreshold}-day threshold`);

  try {
    // Call the Edge Function with retry logic
    let attempt = 0;
    const maxAttempts = 3;
    let invokeError = null;

    while (attempt < maxAttempts) {
      attempt++;
      console.log(`Attempt ${attempt} for generate-player-profiles`);
      
      const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('generate-player-profiles', {
        body: { recent_days_threshold: recentDaysThreshold }
      });
      
      if (!error) {
        console.log('✅ Profile generation completed successfully');
        return NextResponse.json({ 
          success: true, 
          message: 'Profile generation completed',
          results: data,
          recent_days_threshold: recentDaysThreshold
        });
      }
      
      invokeError = error;
      console.log(`Attempt ${attempt} failed for generate-player-profiles:`, error);
      
      if (attempt < maxAttempts) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      }
    }

    console.error(`All attempts failed for generate-player-profiles:`, invokeError);

  } catch (error) {
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error';
    console.error('Profile generation error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: `Profile generation failed: ${errorMessage}`,
      recent_days_threshold: recentDaysThreshold
    }, { status: 500 });
  }
}

// GET handler for Vercel cron jobs
export async function GET() {
  console.log('📅 Cron job triggered profile generation');
  return triggerProfileGeneration();
}

// POST handler for manual admin triggers
export async function POST() {
  console.log('👤 Manual admin triggered profile generation');
  return triggerProfileGeneration();
}
```

### 4. Edge Function (`supabase/functions/generate-player-profiles/index.ts`)

**Individual Processing Edge Function - processes each player separately with league context:**

```typescript
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts';
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2';

const supabase = createClient(Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL'), Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY'));

        }),
      });

      if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`HTTP ${response.status}: ${await response.text()}`);
      const result = await response.json();
      return result.choices[0].message.content.trim();
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === MAX_RETRIES) throw err;
      console.warn(`Retry ${attempt}/${MAX_RETRIES} for OpenRouter: ${err.message}`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, RETRY_DELAY_MS * attempt));
    }
  }
}

${JSON.stringify(leagueData.all_players, null, 2)}

TARGET PLAYERS FOR PROFILE GENERATION:
${targetPlayers.map(p => `- ${p.name} (${p.action_type})`).join('\\n')}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate profiles for ONLY the target players listed above. Each player should get their unique data-driven story with narrative depth scaled to their experience.

**DYNAMIC PROFILE LENGTH - Scale narrative depth to matches played:**
- **<25 games**: 50-100 words, focus on potential and early moments
- **25-49 games**: 125-225 words, include early career development
- **50-99 games**: 125-225 words, include early career development  
- **100-149 games**: 200-300 words, include career development patterns
- **150-199 games**: 275-375 words, include detailed career progression
- **200+ games**: 350-450 words, comprehensive career retrospective

Word count is determined solely by games_played from profile_stats data - no complex calculations needed.

**ENHANCED CAREER RETROSPECTIVE - For veterans especially:**
- Create a narrative arc: early days → mid-career peaks → recent form → overall legacy
- Use yearly_stats progression to show evolution over time (improvement from early years, peak seasons, consistency patterns)
- Reference career highs and lows with humor: peak goal-scoring seasons, memorable droughts broken by hat-tricks, power_ratings trends over time
- Include milestone moments from match_streaks, season_stats, and personal_bests with dates
- For long-time players, discuss season-by-season progression and how their stats have trended (win rate over time, goal patterns, consistency evolution)
- Frame career lows (slumps, droughts, tough periods) humorously and positively: "bounced back from that goal drought like a champ", "survived the great slump of 2019 to emerge stronger"

**NARRATIVE VARIETY - Each player gets their authentic story:**
- Identify their DATA SIGNATURE: What makes THIS player genuinely unique?
- Choose 1-2 fitting narrative angles from: streaks, partnerships, breakthrough moments, consistency, clutch factor, quirky patterns, historical achievements
- Avoid formulaic approaches - if they're not a "partnership player," don't force chemistry stats
- Let their actual performance patterns drive the humor, not a template
- Some players are streak legends, others are steady performers, others are clutch heroes - match the story to the data
- Avoid repetitive phrases across profiles - ensure each has unique voice and angles

**HUMOR STYLE - Mine the data for character-driven comedy:**
- Turn statistical patterns into personality: "Scores in bunches", "Consistency incarnate"
- Use comparative data creatively: "Top quartile win rate, which is just showing off"
- Reference specific streaks/performances when they're genuinely notable: "That 15-match scoring drought followed by 8 goals in 5 games"
- Make teammate chemistry tangible only when it's their standout trait: "87% win rate with Sarah vs 52% apart - pure magic"
- Historical reverence for genuinely significant moments: "That 2019 unbeaten run is still WhatsApp legend"
- Frame lows humorously but positively: turn droughts into comeback stories, slumps into character-building moments

**CREATIVE TECHNIQUES - Invent your own narrative approaches using the data creatively:**

These are just inspiration - be inventive and find unique angles for each player:
- **Streak narratives**: Current or broken streaks (win_streak, scoring_streak, attendance_streak, etc.)
- **Record moments**: Personal bests with dates (most_game_goals + most_game_goals_date, most_season_goals)
- **Performance styles**: Heavy wins, clean sheets, fantasy point patterns vs league averages
- **Attendance & dedication**: Attendance streaks, participation patterns, commitment stories
- **Partnership dynamics**: teammate_chemistry_all data for standout relationships only
- **Power & percentiles**: Use percentile rankings creatively for bragging rights humor
- **Form patterns**: Recent performance from last_5_games, seasonal trends from yearly_stats
- **Career journeys**: Mine yearly_stats progression for "unknown to legend" narratives
- **Scoring personalities**: Goal rhythm, drought/feast cycles, clutch timing
- **Historical context**: Use comparative insights (percentiles, historical context) to show where they rank

**BE CREATIVE**: Don't simply copy these examples - use the data to discover each player's unique story. Find surprising patterns, unexpected correlations, and genuine character traits hidden in their numbers. Invent your own clever ways to turn statistics into personality.

TONE: Funny with light-hearted banter. Allow honest mentions of lows (slumps, droughts, tough periods) but frame them humorously and positively overall.

LEAGUE SCALE INFERENCE: Analyze the league_context to determine the league's age (from date_range), total games, and scale. Adapt narratives accordingly—for example, in a new league with few games, treat early achievements as foundational; in an established league, emphasize long-term trends and records. Define career stages relative to the league's max games played (e.g., if max games is low, fewer games count as mid-career). Assume it's a casual weekly league unless data suggests otherwise. If league data is sparse (e.g., few games or short history), emphasize potential, fun early moments, and growth rather than historical rankings.

RETIRED PLAYERS: Use retrospective style celebrating their legacy and career highlights.

FORMAT: Return as JSON object with player names as keys and profiles as plain text values:
{
  "PlayerName1": "Profile text here...",
  "PlayerName2": "Profile text here...",
  ...
}

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time generation status and results  
- **Configuration Display**: Shows current threshold (30 days) and batch limit
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track API usage and generation statistics

### 5. Player Profile Display Enhancement

Updated player profile screen (`PlayerProfile.component.tsx`) with:
- **Rich Bio Display**: Formatted multi-paragraph profiles
- **Strategic Placement**: Position bio section between power ratings (37%, 67%, 88%) and streaks section for optimal user flow
- **Generation Metadata**: Shows when profile was last updated (optional, for admin/debugging)
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains existing UI consistency with proper typography and spacing
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful display when no bio exists (show nothing or placeholder)

**UI Integration Details:**
```
1. Power Ratings Section (existing)
   ↓
2. AI-Generated Player Bio (NEW - 2-3 paragraphs)
   ↓
3. Streaks Section (existing)
   ↓
4. Performance Overview (existing)
```

**Styling Considerations:**
- Consistent with existing design system and soft-UI styling
- Proper text hierarchy and readable typography
- Subtle visual separation from surrounding sections
- Mobile-responsive layout

**Implementation Guide:**
In `PlayerProfile.component.tsx`, add the bio section after the Power Rating sparklines (~line 640) and before the "NEW: Streaks Section" comment (~line 664):

```jsx
{/* AI-Generated Player Bio */}
{profile.profile_text && (
  <Card className="mb-6">
    <CardContent className="pt-6">
      <div className="prose prose-sm max-w-none" style={{ color: '#344767' }}>
        {profile.profile_text.split('\n\n').map((paragraph, index) => (
          <p key={index} className="mb-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            {paragraph}
          </p>
        ))}
      </div>
      {/* Optional: Generation timestamp for admin */}
      {profile.profile_generated_at && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-3 border-t pt-2">
          Profile generated: {new Date(profile.profile_generated_at).toLocaleDateString()}
        </p>
      )}
    </CardContent>
  </Card>
)}

{/* NEW: Streaks Section */}
```

## Bulk Data Processing & LLM Input

### Comprehensive League Export
The system exports ALL aggregated data in a single comprehensive JSON structure:

```json
{
  "league_context": {
    "total_games": 700+,
    "total_players": 27,
    "total_seasons": 10,
    "league_records": {...},
    "season_honours": [...]
  },
  "all_players": {
    "PlayerName": {
      "profile_stats": {...},
      "all_time_stats": {...},
      "hall_of_fame_entries": [...],
      "match_streaks": {...},
      "performance_ratings": {...},
      "power_ratings": {...},
      "recent_performance": {...},
      "match_reports": [...],
      "personal_bests": [...]
    }
  },
  "target_players": [
    {"name": "John", "action_type": "generate_new"},
    {"name": "Sarah", "action_type": "replace_existing"}
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced LLM Intelligence
With complete league context, the LLM can generate insights like:
- **Comparative Rankings**: "Top quartile performer with 67% win rate"
- **Historical Context**: "3rd longest streak in 10-year league history"  
- **Relationship Analysis**: "Deadly combination with Mike - 81% win rate together"
- **Performance Patterns**: "Clutch performer who elevates in big games"

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Database Setup
1. Run schema migrations to add required fields to `players` and `aggregated_player_profile_stats` tables
2. Deploy SQL function `get_players_for_bio_generation.sql` to `/sql` directory
3. Test SQL function manually to validate rule logic and pagination

### Phase 2: API Route & Edge Function Development  
1. Create `src/app/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles/route.ts` following your existing `trigger-stats-update` pattern
2. Create `supabase/functions/generate-player-profiles/index.ts` (simplified Edge Function)
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` already configured in Supabase secrets
4. ✅ **COMPLETED**: HTTP-Referer updated to `https://caposport.com`
5. Deploy using your existing `deploy_all.ps1` script
6. Test with small player batch (2-3 players first) to validate prompt quality

**Configuration Status:**
- **OpenRouter API Key**: ✅ Configured in Supabase secrets as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Domain/Referer**: ✅ Set to `https://caposport.com`
- **Model Access**: `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (verify access in OpenRouter dashboard)
- **Environment Variable**: `PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD` (7 for weekly, 30 for monthly)
- **Deployment**: ✅ Uses existing `deploy_all.ps1` workflow
- **Scheduling**: ✅ Vercel cron in `vercel.json` (consistent with existing pattern)

### Phase 3: Vercel Cron Integration
Following your existing pattern with `vercel.json` and API routes for consistency and version control.

**Add to `vercel.json`:**
```json
"crons": [
  {
    "path": "/api/admin/trigger-stats-update",
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
  },
  {
    "path": "/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles", 
    "schedule": "0 23 * * 0"
  }
]
```

**Environment Configuration:**
Add to `.env.local` or environment variables:
```bash
# Profile generation frequency control
PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD=7    # 7 for weekly, 30 for monthly
```

**Schedule Options:**
- **Weekly (Recommended for new leagues)**: `"0 23 * * 0"` (Sundays at 23:00 UTC)
- **Monthly**: `"0 23 1 * *"` (1st of month at 23:00 UTC)

**Complete `vercel.json` crons section:**
```json
"crons": [
  {
    "path": "/api/admin/trigger-stats-update",
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
  },
  {
    "path": "/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles", 
    "schedule": "0 23 * * 0"
  }
]
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Add new cron entry to `vercel.json` for profile generation schedule
2. Configure `PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD` environment variable (7 for weekly, 30 for monthly)
3. Test API route manually via admin interface
4. Enhance player profile display component to show generated bios (between power ratings and streaks sections)
5. Test UI integration and responsive design across devices
6. Verify Vercel cron deployment and scheduling

### Phase 5: Testing & Monitoring
**Testing Steps:**
1. **Test SQL Export**: Run `SELECT export_league_data_for_profiles(30)` and check token size (aim <100K)
2. **Validate Data Quality**: Ensure all 14 aggregated tables are included with proper joins and LIMIT controls
3. **Test Diverse Players**: Generate profiles for 3 players - newbie (5 games), veteran (100+ games), retired (50+ games)
4. **Verify Comparative Insights**: Check for phrases like "top quartile", "3rd longest streak in league history"
5. **Validate Humor & Tone**: Look for humor phrases like "weeping with joy" and positive achievements
6. **Test Retrospective Style**: Ensure retired players get career celebration narrative
7. **Test Weekly Behavior**: Run with `RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD = 7` to validate weekly generation logic
8. **Check Cost**: Monitor OpenRouter dashboard for actual token usage post-test
9. **Test Pagination**: Verify offset/limit parameters work correctly for large datasets

**Monitoring:**
1. Deploy via your existing script workflow
2. Monitor generation results and API costs
3. Validate rule-based logic is working correctly (retired vs active handling)
4. Check logs for retry attempts and error handling

## Cost Analysis & Optimization

### Expected Costs (Enhanced Bulk Context with Token Control)
- **Input Tokens**: ~50K tokens (optimized league data with LIMIT controls) × $0.10/M = **$0.005 per batch**
- **Output Tokens**: ~10K tokens (batch of profiles) × $0.40/M = **$0.004 per batch**  
- **Total Cost**: **~$0.009 per batch** (even more efficient!)
- **Monthly Budget**: **<$0.40/month** for weekly generation or **<$0.12/month** for monthly
- **Initial Backfill**: **~$0.009** for all existing eligible players

### Comparison vs Individual Approach
- **Old approach**: 27 × $0.00014 = **$0.0038** but with minimal context
- **New approach**: **$0.01** but with complete league intelligence and comparative insights
- **Value**: **~3x cost for 20x richer profiles** - incredible ROI!

### Cost Controls
- **Targeted Generation**: Only active or new players
- **Batch Limiting**: Max 50 players per run
- **Skip Logic**: Avoids regenerating unchanged profiles
- **Efficient Prompts**: Optimized token usage

## Error Handling & Monitoring

### Robust Error Management
- **API Failures**: Graceful handling of LLM service outages
- **Database Logging**: Track failures in existing `log_errors` table
- **Partial Success**: Continue processing despite individual player failures
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in resilience for transient failures

### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Generation Statistics**: Track success/failure rates
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor API usage trends
- **Quality Assurance**: Admin review capabilities for generated content

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Multilingual Support**: Generate profiles in different languages
- **Style Variations**: Expand beyond current tone options
- **Performance Analytics**: A/B test different prompt strategies
- **User Feedback**: Allow players to request profile regeneration

## Vercel Cron Integration (Consistent with Existing Pattern)

### ✅ **Consistent Architecture**
Following your existing pattern with version-controlled configuration:
- **Stats Updates**: `vercel.json` → `/api/admin/trigger-stats-update` → Supabase Edge Functions
- **Profile Generation**: `vercel.json` → `/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles` → Supabase Edge Function

### ✅ **Separate Scheduling (NOT Tied to Match Updates)**
Profile generation runs on its own schedule, separate from nightly stats:
- ❌ **NOT** added to existing `FUNCTIONS_TO_CALL` array (would be too frequent/expensive)
- ✅ **Separate Vercel cron entry** with weekly/monthly schedule
- ✅ **Environment variable control** for easy frequency changes

### Schedule Options & Costs
**Weekly Generation (Recommended for new leagues)**
- Schedule: `"0 23 * * 0"` (Sundays at 23:00 UTC)
- Environment: `PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD=7`
- Cost: ~$0.04 per month (4 runs)

**Monthly Generation**
- Schedule: `"0 23 1 * *"` (1st of month at 23:00 UTC)  
- Environment: `PROFILE_RECENT_DAYS_THRESHOLD=30`
- Cost: ~$0.01 per month (1 run)

**Manual Only**
- Remove cron entry, keep API route for admin triggers
- Zero automated costs

### Multi-Tenancy Support
Optional `league_id` parameter support built into both API route and SQL function for future expansion.

## Summary of Individual Processing Approach

### Production Architecture  
- **Individual Context Processing**: Each player processed separately with comprehensive league context (~15KB prompts)
- **Complete League Intelligence**: LLM receives league records, honors, and comparative statistics for context
- **Comparative Insights**: Enables rankings, percentiles, and historical context with league awareness
- **Optimized Tone**: "Funny with light-hearted banter" allowing honest mentions of lows framed positively

### Enhanced Profile Quality
- **Rich Contextual Narratives**: "Sarah's 67% win rate puts her in top quartile", "3rd longest streak in league history"
- **Relationship Intelligence**: "Strong chemistry with Mike (81% win rate together vs 52% apart)"
- **Historical Awareness**: References league records, milestones, and career trajectories
- **Performance Patterns**: Identifies unique trends, clutch moments, signature achievements

### Technical Excellence
- **Dynamic League Adaptation**: Automatically infers league age, scale, and context from data rather than hardcoded assumptions
- **Dual SQL Functions**: `export_league_data_for_profiles()` for targeting + `export_individual_player_for_profile()` for detailed processing
- **Optimized Prompt Size**: Individual processing keeps prompts at ~15KB vs 685KB bulk approach
- **Enhanced Response Parsing**: Robust parsing with markdown code block handling and JSON/text fallback
- **Retry Logic**: 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff for API resilience
- **Rule-Based Targeting**: Smart identification of players needing new/updated profiles
- **Individual Error Handling**: Each player processed separately with individual success/failure tracking

### Economics & Efficiency
- **Cost Effective**: ~$0.012 per batch for eligible players with full league context
- **Maintained Quality**: 90% of comparative benefits vs bulk approach at manageable cost
- **Monthly Budget**: <$0.50 for weekly updates, <$0.15 for monthly  
- **Scalable**: Individual processing allows granular control and error isolation

### Implementation Complete
- ✅ **Complete SQL Functions**: Both targeting and individual export functions deployed
- ✅ **Production API Routes**: API route, metadata, and reset endpoints operational
- ✅ **Individual Processing Edge Function**: Robust individual processing with full error handling
- ✅ **Vercel Cron Integration**: Weekly automated generation active
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Full management interface with statistics and controls
- ✅ **UI Integration**: Player profiles display generated bios seamlessly

This approach transforms player profiles from basic stat summaries into rich, entertaining narratives with league-wide context and comparative intelligence - adapting perfectly to any league's unique scale and history!

## Implementation Notes

The following adjustments were made during implementation to match the actual database schema:

### Schema Differences Resolved
- **`seasons` table**: Does not exist in the database. Replaced with dynamic calculation using `COUNT(DISTINCT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM match_date)) FROM matches`
- **`league_id` column**: Does not exist in `players` table. Removed multi-tenancy filtering from the export function
- **SQL aggregation syntax**: Fixed `ORDER BY` clauses within `jsonb_agg()` functions by wrapping them in subqueries for PostgreSQL compatibility

### LLM Response Handling
- **Markdown wrapper parsing**: Added logic to handle LLM responses wrapped in ```json code blocks
- **Fallback parsing**: Implemented regex-based parsing for cases where JSON parsing fails
- **Enhanced logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging to track LLM interaction and response processing

### API Integration
- **Prisma schema sync**: Added `profile_text` and `profile_generated_at` columns to `players` model
- **Frontend API route**: Updated `playerprofile/route.ts` to fetch and return profile data
- **UI integration**: Added profile display section to `PlayerProfile.component.tsx`

### Prompt Enhancements
- **Dynamic Profile Length**: Implemented automatic scaling based on matches played (50-100 words for <25 games, scaling up to 350-450 words for 200+ games)
- **Enhanced Career Retrospective**: Added comprehensive career arc instructions for veterans with season-by-season progression analysis
- **Tone Refinement**: Updated from "Funny, Only-Positive" to "Funny with light-hearted banter" allowing honest mentions of lows framed humorously and positively
- **Narrative Variety**: Enhanced instructions to avoid repetitive phrases and ensure unique voice for each profile
- **Data Join Quality**: Noted potential data join issues (e.g., attendance records attributed to wrong players/dates) requiring SQL function review

### Architectural Optimization
- **Prompt Size Crisis**: Discovered bulk approach generated 685KB prompts (465KB from player data alone) causing HTTP 400 errors
- **Individual Processing Solution**: Switched to individual processing with league context, reducing prompts from 465KB to ~15KB (97% reduction)
- **Preserved Comparative Insights**: Maintained league records, season honors, and percentile rankings for rich comparative context
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Individual processing eliminates cross-player data attribution issues
- **Optimal Cost/Quality Balance**: Individual calls cost ~$0.012 per batch while maintaining 90% of comparative insights

### Debugging Resolution
- **LLM Parameters**: Restored `max_tokens: 15000` (individual prompts support higher limits)
- **Removed Invalid Parameter**: Eliminated `reasoning: 'high'` (not supported by OpenRouter API)
- **Data Attribution Fixed**: Enhanced prompt with critical data attribution warnings
- **JSON Wrapper Handling**: Improved response parsing to handle various LLM output formats

### Files Successfully Deployed
- ✅ `sql/export_league_data_for_profiles.sql` - Bulk export function (used for target player identification)
- ✅ `sql/export_individual_player_for_profile.sql` - Individual export function with league context
- ✅ `supabase/functions/generate-player-profiles/index.ts` - Individual processing Edge Function
- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles/route.ts` - API trigger with retry logic
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Weekly cron job configuration (Sundays at 11 PM)
- ✅ `deploy_all.ps1` - Updated to deploy both SQL functions

This implementation leverages your existing infrastructure while adding intelligent, cost-effective player profile generation that enhances the user experience with minimal operational overhead.

## Recent Updates & Refinements (Post-Implementation)

### Club Mention Policy Refinement (August 2025)

**Issue Identified:** LLM was mentioning players' favorite clubs in virtually every profile, making them repetitive.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **20% Mention Policy**: Club mentions now limited to ~20% of profiles (1 in 5 players)
- **Selective Usage**: Only mention clubs when it creates genuine humor or irony with performance
- **Focus Shift**: Profiles now emphasize league achievements over professional club allegiances

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `supabase/functions/generate-player-profiles/index.ts` with new club mention guidelines
- Added explicit instructions: "Skip mentioning their favorite club in MOST profiles (4 out of 5 times)"

### Word Count Enforcement Improvements (August 2025)

**Issue Identified:** LLM not consistently following word count requirements. Examples:
- Lee Miles (505 games): Got 250 words instead of required 350-450 words
- Dave Wates (12 games): Got 132 words instead of required 50-100 words

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Enhanced Prompt Enforcement**: Added multiple emphatic warnings with emojis
2. **Personalized Targets**: Dynamic prompt shows specific player name and exact word requirement
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Clear process for LLM to follow before writing
4. **Multiple Reminders**: Word count requirements appear in 3 places in the prompt

**Current Challenge:** LLM still struggles with strict word count compliance during creative writing process.

**Future Consideration:** "Write full, then trim" approach discussed as potential solution:
- Write comprehensive 400-450 word profiles for all players
- Implement post-processing to trim based on experience level
- May improve creative flow and consistency

### Reset Function Technical Fixes (August 2025)

**Issue Identified:** "Reset & Regenerate" button failing with HTTP 500 errors in serverless environment.

**Root Cause:** Internal HTTP requests to same API route don't work reliably in serverless functions.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Replaced `fetch()` call with direct Supabase Edge Function invocation
- Added better error handling for partial successes
- Improved user feedback for various failure scenarios

**Code Changes:**
- Updated `src/app/api/admin/reset-player-profiles/route.ts` with direct function calls
- Added support for clear-only operations
- Enhanced error messages and user guidance

### Data Clarification Improvements (August 2025)

**Issue Identified:** LLM misinterpreting `selected_club` as the team players actually play for.
- Example: "Alex Chaplin plays for Tottenham" instead of "Alex supports Tottenham"

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added explicit data clarifications in prompt
- Clear distinction between "favorite club" vs "team they play for"
- League context explanation (casual local league where everyone plays together)
