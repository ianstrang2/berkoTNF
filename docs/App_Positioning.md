CAPO — FULL POSITIONING, MESSAGING & TONE STRATEGY (v1 Final)
(Rewritten cleanly from the ground up using all your answers + the refined tone.)

1️⃣ SUMMARY POSITIONING STATEMENT
Capo is the high-energy, banter-fuelled 5-a-side app your mates will obsess over.
 It turns a casual kickabout into something you all talk about all week — with stats, AI-balanced teams, streaks, match reports and all the bragging rights.
For organisers, Capo quietly removes the painful bits: chasing people, sorting dropouts, handling payments and forming fair teams.
 They keep the kudos and the social glue — Capo takes away the stress.
Unlike WhatsApp (fun but chaotic) and Spond (functional but lifeless), Capo brings hype, identity and excitement to casual football — while still being rock-solid for admin.
Built by real players who ran the same group for eight years, Capo is designed with love for real mates’ football.

2️⃣ TARGET USERS — DUAL-USER MODEL
Admins / Organisers
The one who brings balls and bibs, chases RSVPs, deals with dropouts and keeps the group alive.
Motivations:
Social value / being the glue

Being reliable


Keeping the game well-attended


Avoiding chaos and arguments


Top pain points (ranked):

Chasing payments


Being blamed for unbalanced teams


Feeling pressure to keep things running smoothly


Emotional goal: Less stress, more warmth from the group — but not losing the human part of running it.
Adoption barrier: Fear players won’t use it; concern it’s too complicated.

Bragging rights


Seeing their AI profile


Streaks, goals/min, form, match reports

Something to talk about at the pub
