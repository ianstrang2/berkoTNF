## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical: Duplicate Header on Leaderboard Page
**Problem**: `/records/leaderboard` shows duplicate purple headers stacked on top of each other

**Details**:
- Only affects leaderboard page, not legends or feats
- React DevTools shows TWO MainLayout components in tree
- Persists after:
  - Hard refresh
  - Clearing cache
  - Deleting `.next` folder and rebuilding
  - Closing browser and reopening

**Files Involved**:
- `src/app/records/layout.tsx` - Records layout (wraps in MainLayout)
- `src/app/records/leaderboard/page.tsx` - Leaderboard page
- `src/components/records/LeaderboardStats.component.tsx` - Leaderboard component
- `src/components/layout/MainLayout.layout.tsx` - Main layout component

**Theories**:
- Possibly related to `/records/page.tsx` redirect causing double render
- Might be Next.js layout nesting issue
- Could be specific to leaderboard component structure

**Not Yet Tried**:
- Remove `/records/page.tsx` redirect
- Create `/records/leaderboard/layout.tsx` to override parent
- Debug with Next.js layout inspector
- Check if it's a Suspense boundary issue

## ✅ What's Working Perfectly

**Web Authentication**:
- ✓ Admin login (email/password)
- ✓ Invitation system
- ✓ Superadmin 3-way view selector (Platform/Admin/Player)
- ✓ Admin-player view switching ("View as Player" button)
- ✓ Context-aware navigation
- ✓ Logout functionality
- ✓ Profile API
- ✓ All pages except leaderboard

**Mobile (Capacitor)**:
- ✓ Android platform configured
- ✓ Live reload working (10.0.2.2:3000)
- ✓ StatusBar matches app theme (purple)
- ✓ Safe-area padding prevents overlap
- ✓ MobileHeader renders correctly
- ✓ Platform detection working

**Database**:
- ✓ All auth tables created
- ✓ RLS policies active
- ✓ Multi-tenant isolation working
- ✓ Activity logging functioning

## 📋 TODO Next

### Immediate (Before Phase 3)
1. **Fix leaderboard duplicate header** (blocking issue)
2. ~~Create superadmin account~~ ✅ Done
3. **Test mobile header** on Android device/emulator

### Phase 3: Player Authentication
1. Configure Supabase phone provider (Twilio/MessageBird)
2. Implement player signup flow (phone/SMS OTP)
3. Build profile claiming UI
4. Configure deep links for auth callbacks
5. Test full mobile player authentication
6. Hide logout from mobile headers (move to settings)

## 🔧 Technical Context

**Architecture**:
- Next.js 14 App Router
- Supabase Auth (email + phone providers)
- Prisma ORM
- Capacitor for native apps
- Multi-tenant with RLS

**Auth Flow**:
- Admins: Email/password → `admin_profiles` table
- Players: Phone/SMS OTP → `players.auth_user_id` link (Phase 3)
- Superadmins: Email/password, `tenant_id = NULL`

**Navigation Model**:
- Context-aware (based on URL, not just role)
- Superadmin: 3 views (Platform/Admin/Player)
- Admin with player link: 2 views (Admin/Player)
- Regular players: 1 view (Player only)

**Mobile vs Web**:
- Web: Full headers with logo, controls, logout
- Mobile: Simplified headers, no logout, centered controls
- Platform detection: `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()`

## 🛠️ Commands to Resume

**Start dev server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test on Android**:
```bash
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

**Regenerate Prisma** (if schema changes):
```bash
# Stop dev server first
npx prisma generate
# Restart dev server
```

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Two-account strategy**: Separate superadmin (`+1` email) from admin account
2. **Context-aware UI**: Navigation based on URL, not just permissions
3. **3-way view selector**: Superadmin can test all three perspectives
4. **Layout persistence**: Prevents sidebar flashing (Next.js best practice)
5. **Profile caching**: Prevents navigation flicker
6. **Service role for app_metadata**: Required for tenant switching
7. **Mobile-first player pages**: Accessible on web for testing

---

## 📞 Questions for Next Session

1. Should we remove the `/records/page.tsx` redirect to fix double header?
2. Do we want to add a dev-only floating "Switch View" button for easier testing?
3. When to tackle Phase 3 (player phone auth)?
4. Should we build the superadmin account creation before or after fixing leaderboard?

## 🎓 Lessons from This Session

1. **Next.js layouts**: Must be at correct level or causes nesting issues
2. **Prisma regeneration**: Required after schema changes, locks if dev server running
3. **UUID type casting**: Raw SQL needs `::uuid` casts for tenant_id comparisons
4. **Profile caching**: Essential for smooth navigation, prevents refetch loops
5. **Supabase service role**: Required for `app_metadata` updates, not regular client
6. **Context-aware > role-aware**: Base UI on current URL for clearer UX
7. **Cache invalidation**: Sometimes need to delete `.next` and rebuild from scratch

**Ready for next session to tackle the leaderboard issue and move to Phase 3!** 🚀
