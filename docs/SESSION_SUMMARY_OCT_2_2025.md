## 📊 Current Architecture

### Authentication Model (v5.0 - Phone-Only)

**Club Users** (players + admins):
- Auth: Phone/SMS via Supabase
- Storage: `players` table with `is_admin` flag
- Promotion: Toggle `is_admin` (no separate invitation)
- Works on: Desktop, mobile web, Capacitor app

**Superadmin** (platform management):
- Auth: Email/password via Supabase
- Storage: `admin_profiles` table
- Access: Desktop only
- Separate from club-level users

---

## 🎯 What's Left (30 Minutes)

### App-First Landing Page
**File**: `/join/[tenant]/[token]/page.tsx`

**Mobile**: Show app download CTA + web fallback  
**Desktop**: Show QR code

**Copy**: 
- Benefits (RSVP-specific)
- Primary CTA: "Download the Capo App"
- Fallback: "Continue on web →" (with warning)

### Deep Link Configuration
**Files**: `capacitor.config.ts`, `AndroidManifest.xml`

**Setup**: `capo://` scheme, intent filters, universal links

**Result**: Invite links open app if installed

---

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Phone-only auth**: Simpler than dual system, matches sports apps
2. **Admin = privileged player**: No separate account type
3. **Promotion over invitation**: Click toggle vs email workflow
4. **App-first onboarding**: Critical for RSVP push notifications
5. **No app install tracking**: Not actionable, focus on claimed status
6. **No last-active tracking**: RSVP metrics more valuable

## 📱 User Flows (Final)

### Player Joins:
1. Admin shares pre-filled WhatsApp message
2. Player taps link → App download screen
3. Downloads app → Opens with invite link
4. Phone verify → Auto-linked by phone
5. Ready for RSVP!

### Admin Promotion:
1. Player joins (above flow)
2. Admin goes to Players table
3. Clicks "PLAYER" button → Confirms
4. Now shows "ADMIN" (purple)
5. Player can access `/admin/*`

### Desktop Admin Work:
1. Go to capo.app
2. Login with phone (gets SMS)
3. Stays logged in for weeks
4. Manage club as usual
