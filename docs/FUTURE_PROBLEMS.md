# Future Technical Debt & Scaling Challenges

This document tracks potential problems and limitations that may need to be addressed as BerkoTNF scales. These are not current blockers but should be monitored and planned for.

---

## **Multi-League Identity**
**Problem**: Player in multiple Capo leagues with same phone number  
**Current**: Multi-tenant architecture with tenant_id isolation (SOLVED)  
**Implementation**: Same phone can exist across tenants with proper data isolation  
**Priority**: âœ… RESOLVED - Multi-tenant architecture handles this correctly  

---

## **Payment Authorization Timing**
**Problem**: How long can we hold payment auth for confirmed bookings?  
**Current**: Payment auth on confirmation only (no pending holds in simplified version)  
**Constraint**: Stripe auth holds expire after 7 days (plenty of time)  
**Future**: May need immediate auth for high-demand matches  
**Priority**: Medium (affects payment user experience when billing is added)  

---

## **Profile Name Conflicts**
**Problem**: Multiple players with same display name  
**Current**: 14-char limit forces unique-ish names  
**Future**: May need surname initials or numbers (John S., John M.)  
**Priority**: Medium (affects user experience as leagues grow)  
**Solution Ideas**: Auto-append initials, allow longer names, use avatars  

---

## **Bulk Operations**
**Problem**: Admin managing 100+ player leagues  
**Current**: One-by-one approval workflow  
**Future**: Bulk approval tools, CSV import/export  
**Priority**: Medium (affects admin efficiency at scale)  
**Solution Ideas**: Batch operations, admin assistant roles, automation rules  

---

## **Cross-Platform Notifications**
**Problem**: Ensuring all admins get critical notifications  
**Current**: Push to mobile app only  
**Future**: Email fallback, SMS backup, web notifications  
**Priority**: High (affects match organization reliability)  
**Solution Ideas**: Multi-channel notification system, notification preferences  

---

## **Data Export & Migration**
**Problem**: League wants to switch to different system or export data  
**Current**: No export functionality  
**Future**: Full data export, migration tools  
**Priority**: Low (but important for trust and compliance)  
**Solution Ideas**: JSON export, CSV formats, API for third-party tools  

---

## **Advanced Team Balancing**
**Problem**: Complex balancing across multiple seasons and historical data  
**Current**: Single-match balancing with basic algorithms  
**Future**: Cross-season analysis, machine learning, advanced statistics  
**Priority**: Low (nice-to-have enhancement)  
**Solution Ideas**: ML-based balancing, seasonal form tracking, advanced metrics  

---

## **Real-Time Collaboration**
**Problem**: Multiple admins managing same match simultaneously  
**Current**: Basic concurrency protection  
**Future**: Real-time collaborative editing, conflict resolution  
**Priority**: Medium (affects multi-admin leagues)  
**Solution Ideas**: WebSocket updates, operational transforms, live cursors  

---

## **Mobile App Distribution**
**Problem**: App store approval, updates, platform differences  
**Current**: Web-first approach  
**Future**: Native app store presence, update mechanisms  
**Priority**: Medium (affects push notification reliability)  
**Solution Ideas**: Progressive Web App, Capacitor updates, store optimization  

---

## **Regulatory Compliance**
**Problem**: GDPR, data protection, youth player safeguarding  
**Current**: Basic privacy controls  
**Future**: Full compliance framework, audit trails, data retention  
**Priority**: High (legal requirement in many jurisdictions)  
**Solution Ideas**: Privacy dashboard, consent management, audit logging  

---

## **Performance at Scale**
**Problem**: Database performance with thousands of matches and players  
**Current**: Optimized for small-medium leagues  
**Future**: Database sharding, caching layers, CDN optimization  
**Priority**: Medium (affects user experience at scale)  
**Solution Ideas**: Read replicas, Redis caching, image optimization  

---

## **Integration Ecosystem**
**Problem**: Leagues want to integrate with other sports management tools  
**Current**: Standalone system  
**Future**: API ecosystem, webhooks, third-party integrations  
**Priority**: Low (but important for competitive differentiation)  
**Solution Ideas**: Public API, webhook system, integration marketplace
