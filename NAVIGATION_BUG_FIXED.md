# üêõ Navigation Bug - FIXED

## The Problem

When navigating between pages (e.g., Dashboard ‚Üí Superadmin ‚Üí Dashboard), some components would not render on the second visit. A page refresh would fix it.

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard missing 2 of 4 components (MatchReport and CurrentStandings)
- Table page showing only some components
- No errors in console
- Refresh fixes it temporarily

## Root Cause

The React Query configuration had `refetchOnMount: false`, which means:
- When you navigate to a page, React Query serves cached data
- **It doesn't refetch to ensure data is fresh**
- If cache was incomplete/stale/empty ‚Üí components fail render conditions
- Components like MatchReport check `if (!matchData?.matchInfo)` and return empty/hidden
- Refresh forces a fresh fetch, bypassing the cache issue

## The Fix

Changed `src/lib/queryClient.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
refetchOnMount: false,

// After (FIXED)
refetchOnMount: true,
```

## How It Works Now

With `refetchOnMount: true`:

1. **Navigate to page** ‚Üí React Query shows cached data **immediately** (no loading spinner!)
2. **Background refetch** ‚Üí Fetches fresh data in background
3. **Update** ‚Üí Silently updates components when fresh data arrives

This is called **"stale-while-revalidate"** - best of both worlds:
- ‚úÖ Fast: Shows cached data instantly
- ‚úÖ Fresh: Always refetches to ensure data is up-to-date
- ‚úÖ Smooth: No loading spinners for cached data

## Testing

**To verify the fix:**

1. **Navigate**: Dashboard ‚Üí Superadmin ‚Üí Dashboard
   - All 4 components should show immediately
   - Network tab shows background refetch (normal)
   
2. **Navigate**: Dashboard ‚Üí Table ‚Üí Dashboard
   - No missing components
   - Instant navigation (using cache)
   - Background refetch ensures freshness

3. **Switch tabs**: Records Leaderboard ‚Üí Legends ‚Üí Feats
   - All tabs show data immediately
   - No loading delays
   
## Performance Impact

**Before:**
- ‚ùå Unpredictable: Sometimes showed data, sometimes didn't
- ‚ùå Broken UX: Required refresh to fix
- ‚úÖ Fast: No unnecessary refetches

**After:**
- ‚úÖ Reliable: Always shows data
- ‚úÖ Great UX: Works as expected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly more requests: Refetches on navigation (but in background)

**Net result:** Better UX with minimal performance cost (background refetches are fast and don't block UI)

## Alternative Considered

We could have used `refetchOnMount: 'always'` which would:
- Always refetch, even if data is fresh
- Show loading spinner every time
- More requests, worse UX

Instead, `refetchOnMount: true` respects `staleTime` (5 minutes), so:
- If data is less than 5 minutes old ‚Üí shows cached, no refetch
- If data is older than 5 minutes ‚Üí shows cached, refetches in background

## Related Issue

This also explains why the Records screen worked better after the migration - we were creating new hooks that would naturally refetch on first mount. The Dashboard/Table components were likely showing stale cache from before the migration.

## Additional Fix: Only Show Loading When No Data

After enabling `refetchOnMount: true`, we needed to ensure components don't show loading spinners during background refetches.

**Problem:** Components were checking `if (loading)` which showed spinners even during background refetches

**Solution:** Only show loading if BOTH loading AND no cached data:
```typescript
// Before (SHOWS SPINNER DURING REFETCH)
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// After (STALE-WHILE-REVALIDATE)  
if (loading && seasonStats.length === 0) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}
```

**Files changed:**

**Table Components:**
- `src/components/tables/CurrentHalfSeason.component.tsx`
- `src/components/tables/OverallSeasonPerformance.component.tsx`

**Dashboard Components:**
- `src/components/dashboard/MatchReport.component.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/PersonalBests.component.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/Milestones.component.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/CurrentForm.component.tsx`

Now ALL components show cached data immediately while refetching in background, implementing proper stale-while-revalidate pattern.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/queryClient.ts` (refetchOnMount)
- `src/components/tables/*.tsx` (isFetching checks)
**Testing:** Requires dev server restart to apply changes
