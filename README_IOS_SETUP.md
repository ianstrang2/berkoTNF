# 📱 iOS Setup - Start Here

**Welcome to your iOS mobile app setup!** This guide gets you from zero to App Store submission.

---

## 🎯 TL;DR

### What Changed
- ✅ Fixed white screen issue (wrong `webDir` + hardcoded dev server)
- ✅ Configured proper static export for mobile builds
- ✅ Created API helper for mobile/web compatibility
- ✅ Industry-standard hybrid architecture (like Netflix, Notion, Airbnb)

### What You Need to Do
1. **Transfer project to Mac** (Git or USB)
2. **Run setup commands** (5 minutes)
3. **Update API calls in code** (2-4 hours - optional for now)
4. **Test and deploy**

2. Understand dev vs prod modes
3. Learn troubleshooting

### 💻 "I want to prepare for production"

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Mac Required)

### Step 1: Transfer Project (Choose One)

**Option A: Git (Recommended)**
```bash
# On Mac
cd ~/Developer
git clone <your-repo-url> capo
cd capo
npm install
```

**Option B: Direct Transfer**
- Copy folder to Mac via USB/AirDrop/network
- On Mac: `cd ~/path/to/capo && npm install`

---

### Step 2: Add iOS Platform
```bash
npx cap add ios
```

**Creates:**
- `ios/` directory
- Xcode project files
- Info.plist for configuration

---

### Step 3: Configure Deep Links

Edit `ios/App/App/Info.plist` and paste content from:
```
docs/ios_info_plist_config.xml
```

**Adds:**
- Custom scheme: `capo://`
- Universal links: `https://capo.app/join/*`
- Dev server support

---

### Step 4: Test!

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Launch iOS with live reload
npm run ios:dev
```

**App opens in simulator!** Changes appear instantly.

**Capacitor 7 Note:** The `--dev` flag automatically detects your dev server at `localhost:3000`. No manual IP configuration needed!

## 🏗️ Architecture (30-Second Explanation)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         WEB APP (Vercel)                │
│  Next.js with API routes + Database     │
│         ↓ Same codebase ↓               │
│     MOBILE APP (iOS/Android)            │
│  Static UI + Calls API via HTTPS        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Points:**
- **UI**: Bundled in app (fast, offline, no white screen!)
- **API**: Calls production server (Vercel)
- **Data**: Your 80+ API routes stay on server
- **This is how all modern hybrid apps work**

## 🎮 Essential Commands

```bash
# Development (live reload - RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING)
npm run ios:dev         # iOS with live reload (Mac)
npm run android:dev     # Android with live reload (PC/Mac)

# Production builds (requires deployed API)
npm run ios:build       # Build + open Xcode (Mac)
npm run android:build   # Build + open Android Studio (PC/Mac)

# Utilities
npm run build:mobile    # Just build static export
npx cap sync           # Copy files to native platforms
npx cap open ios       # Open Xcode (Mac)
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Development vs Production

**Development Mode** (`npm run ios:dev`):
- ✅ Connects to local dev server
- ✅ Live reload (instant updates)
- ✅ API routes work (same server)
- ✅ Perfect for development

**Production Mode** (`npm run ios:build`):
- ✅ Static UI bundled in app
- ✅ Fast, offline-capable
- ⚠️ Calls production API (must be deployed)
- ⚠️ Requires code migration (use `apiFetch()`)

**For now, use development mode!** Production builds can wait until you're ready to deploy.

---

### API Calls

**Current code (works in web, not mobile prod):**
```typescript
fetch('/api/players')
```

**Updated code (works everywhere):**
```typescript
import { apiFetch } from '@/lib/apiConfig';
apiFetch('/players')
```

**When to update:** Before production mobile build. For testing with live reload, current code works fine!

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "White screen in simulator"
- ✅ **Fixed!** Your config is now correct.
- If you see it: Run `npm run build:mobile` first

### "API calls fail"
- **In dev mode:** Make sure `npm run dev` is running
- **In prod mode:** Make sure API is deployed and CORS configured

### "Deep links don't work"
- Make sure you added Info.plist configuration
- Test with: `xcrun simctl openurl booted "capo://join/ABC123"`

### "Live reload not working"
- Check firewall allows port 3000
- Check Mac and dev machine on same WiFi

**More help:** See `docs/CAPACITOR_BUILD_WORKFLOW.md` → Troubleshooting

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**You're ready for production when:**
- ✅ App runs in iOS simulator (dev mode)
- ✅ Deep links work
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ API calls updated to use `apiFetch()`
- ✅ Production API deployed
- ✅ CORS configured for mobile
- ✅ App runs on physical device
- ✅ Ready for App Store submission

---
