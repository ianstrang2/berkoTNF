-- sql/update_power_ratings.sql  (UPDATED: EWMA Performance Rating System)
-- NEW: Calculates exponentially weighted moving average ratings with 2-year half-life
-- REPLACES: 6-month period-based system with smooth recency weighting
-- SAME FUNCTION NAME: update_power_ratings() - maintains compatibility
