# ‚úÖ Phase 2 Missed Routes - Now Fixed

## Summary

Found and fixed **11 admin API routes** that were created after Phase 2 and were missing `withTenantContext` wrapper.

---

## Why These Were Missed

### Root Cause
These routes were created in commits **after Phase 2 migration completed** (commits `b8873a8` and later).

### The Pattern
They used the **old pattern**:
```typescript
// OLD: Pre-Phase 2 pattern
const { tenantId } = await requireAdminRole(request);
const players = await prisma.players.findMany({
  where: { tenant_id: tenantId }  // Manual filtering only
});
// ‚ùå No RLS context set
// ‚ùå Logs: [PRISMA_MIDDLEWARE] No tenant context
```

### Why This Was a Problem
- ‚úÖ Routes were **secure** (manual `tenant_id` filtering)
- ‚ùå Routes didn't set **RLS context** (AsyncLocalStorage)
- ‚ùå Prisma middleware couldn't monitor or log
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If RLS enforcement was strict, queries could fail

---

## What Was Fixed

### High Priority (Access tenant-scoped data)

1. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/rating-data`** - EWMA performance ratings
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Changed `findUnique` ‚Üí `findFirst` (composite key issue)
   - Added tenant filtering

2. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/info-data`** - Absentees and ringers
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Added `tenant_id` filter to `players.findMany()`

3. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/join-requests`** - List pending join requests
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Already had tenant filtering

4. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/join-requests/approve`** - Approve join requests
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Already had tenant filtering

5. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/join-requests/reject`** - Reject join requests
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Already had tenant filtering

6. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/players/promote`** - Promote/demote players to admin
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Already had tenant filtering

7. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/profile/link-player`** - Link admin to player account
   - Added `withTenantContext` (both POST and DELETE methods)
   - Already had tenant filtering

8. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/reset-player-profiles`** - Reset AI player profiles
   - Added `withTenantContext`
   - Added `tenant_id` filter to `players.updateMany()`
   - Pass `tenant_id` to edge function

9. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/trigger-player-profiles`** - Trigger AI profile generation
   - Added `withTenantContext` (both GET and POST methods)
   - Pass `tenant_id` to edge function

10. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/team-slots/clear-all`** - Clear team assignments
    - Added `withTenantContext`
    - Added `tenant_id` filter to `updateMany()` and `findMany()`

11. ‚úÖ **`/api/admin/club-invite`** - Manage invite tokens
    - GET already had `withTenantContext`
    - Added `withTenantContext` to POST method

---

### Low Priority (No tenant context needed)

‚úÖ **`/api/admin/settings`** - Returns hardcoded values (no DB access)  
‚úÖ **`/api/admin/system-health`** - Platform-level diagnostics  
‚úÖ **`/api/admin/debug-revalidation`** - Dev tool (no DB access)  
‚úÖ **`/api/admin/revalidate-cache`** - Platform-level cache  
‚úÖ **`/api/admin/create-club`** - Creates NEW tenants (no tenant exists yet)  

---

## Before vs After

### Before
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const { tenantId } = await requireAdminRole(request);
  
  const data = await prisma.players.findMany({
    where: { tenant_id: tenantId }
  });
  
  return NextResponse.json({ data });
}
```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå No RLS context in AsyncLocalStorage
- ‚ùå Prisma middleware shows: "No tenant context"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If RLS enforcing mode enabled, queries fail

### After
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withTenantContext(request, async (tenantId) => {
    await requireAdminRole(request);  // Still verify admin access
    
    const data = await prisma.players.findMany({
      where: { tenant_id: tenantId }
    });
    
    return NextResponse.json({ data });
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ RLS context set via AsyncLocalStorage
- ‚úÖ Prisma middleware can monitor and log
- ‚úÖ Terminal shows: `[WITH_TENANT_CONTEXT] Setting tenant context`
- ‚úÖ Defense-in-depth (RLS + manual filtering)

---

## How to Prevent This

### Solution 1: Linting Rule (Future)
Create an ESLint rule that checks:
```typescript
// Flag this as error:
if (file.path.startsWith('src/app/api/admin/') && 
    !content.includes('withTenantContext')) {
  error('Admin API route must use withTenantContext wrapper');
}
```

### Solution 2: Code Review Checklist
When creating new admin API routes, verify:
- [ ] Uses `withTenantContext` wrapper
- [ ] All Prisma queries include `tenant_id` filter
- [ ] Terminal logs show `[WITH_TENANT_CONTEXT] Setting tenant context`

### Solution 3: Testing
Before deploying, test each admin page and check terminal for:
- ‚úÖ `[WITH_TENANT_CONTEXT] Setting tenant context: <uuid>`
- ‚ùå `[PRISMA_MIDDLEWARE] No tenant context - RLS may block query`

If you see ‚ùå, that route needs `withTenantContext`.

## Testing Checklist

Test these features to verify the fixes:

### /admin/info Page (or /superadmin/info with tenant context)
- [ ] Absentees table loads
- [ ] Ringers table loads  
- [ ] EWMA ratings dropdown populates
- [ ] Selecting a player shows ratings
- [ ] Player profiles table loads
- [ ] "Update Profiles" button works
- [ ] "Reset & Regenerate" button works

### Admin Features
- [ ] Join requests page shows pending requests
- [ ] Approving join request works
- [ ] Rejecting join request works
- [ ] Promoting player to admin works
- [ ] Linking player to admin account works
- [ ] Team slots "Clear All" button works
- [ ] Club invite link generation works

**Terminal should show:**
```
[WITH_TENANT_CONTEXT] Setting tenant context: <uuid>
[PRISMA_MIDDLEWARE] Set RLS context: <uuid>
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
[PRISMA_MIDDLEWARE] No tenant context - RLS may block query
```
