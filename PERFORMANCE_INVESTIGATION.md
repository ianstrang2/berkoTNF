# Performance Investigation - Findings & Fixes

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### Tenant Resolution Performance ✅
```
⏱️ getSession: 1ms
⏱️ Cookie verification query: 96ms
✅ Total tenant resolution: 111ms
```

**Verdict:** Tenant resolution is **NOT the bottleneck** (111ms is acceptable)

---

## 🚨 Actual Bottlenecks Found

### Before Latest Fixes
```
❌ /api/auth/profile: 4.5 seconds × 4 calls = 18 seconds
❌ /api/admin/app-config: 4.8 seconds × 4 calls = 19.2 seconds
Total waste: ~37 seconds!
```

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. **Profile Called 4x** (useAuth not using React Query)
- `useAuth.hook.ts` was calling `/api/auth/profile` manually
- Every component using `useAuthContext` triggered a new call
- **FIX APPLIED:** Migrated useAuth to React Query ✅

#### 2. **app-config Had Wasteful Test Query**
- Route did a `findFirst` just to check if table exists
- Doubled the database query time unnecessarily
- **FIX APPLIED:** Removed wasteful test query ✅

#### 3. **Current Season Called 4x** (useSeasonTitles not using React Query)
- `useSeasonTitles` was calling `/api/seasons/current` manually
- Used by multiple table components
- **FIX APPLIED:** Migrated to React Query ✅

---

## ✅ Optimizations Applied

### 1. React Query Deduplication
```typescript
// Before: Called 4x
const [profile, setProfile] = useState(null);
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/auth/profile').then(r => setProfile(r));
}, []);

// After: Called 1x, cached and shared
const { data: authData } = useAuthProfile();
```

### 2. Removed Wasteful Queries
```typescript
// Before: app-config route
const testConfig = await prisma.app_config.findFirst(); // Wasteful!
const configs = await prisma.app_config.findMany(); // Actual query

// After:
const configs = await prisma.app_config.findMany(); // Only necessary query
```

### 3. Hooks Migrated to React Query
- ✅ `useAuth` → uses `useAuthProfile()`
- ✅ `useSeasonTitles` → uses `useCurrentSeason()`
- ✅ All table components → use React Query hooks

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Request Count
- Before: 105 requests
- After: **~45-50 requests** (55% reduction)

### Slow Requests Fixed
```
Before:
- profile (4x × 4.5s) = 18 seconds
- app-config (4x × 4.8s) = 19.2 seconds
- current (4x × unknown) = ?
Total: ~40+ seconds of duplicate slow calls

After:
- profile (1x × ?s) = Unknown (need to test)
- app-config (1x × ?s) = Unknown (need to test)
- current (1x × ?s) = Unknown (need to test)
Total: ~3-5 seconds (assuming queries are still slow)
```

**Key Question:** Are the individual requests still slow?
- If yes → Database query optimization needed
- If no → Problem was just duplication (now fixed!)

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Refresh the Table Page
Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R) and reload

### 2. Check Network Tab (Filter: /api/)
Look for:
- **profile** - Should be **1x** now (not 4x)
- **app-config** - Should be **1x** now (not 4x)
- **seasons/current** - Should be **1x** now (not 4x)

### 3. Check Individual Request Times
For each API call, check the **Time** column:
- **If <500ms:** Problem was just duplication ✅
- **If still 4+ seconds:** Database queries need optimization 🚨

### 4. Check Server Console
Look for the `⏱️ [TENANT]` logs - they'll show exactly where time is spent

---

## 🎯 Next Actions Based on Results

### Scenario A: Requests are now fast (<500ms)
✅ **Problem solved!** It was just duplication
- Continue to Records screen migration
- No database optimization needed

### Scenario B: Individual requests still slow (4+ seconds)
🚨 **Database queries are the problem**
- Need to investigate which specific queries are slow
- Check Supabase dashboard for slow query logs
- May need indexes, query optimization, or connection pooling

---

## 🔧 Additional Optimizations Ready (If Needed)

### If Database Queries Are Slow:

**Option 1: Add Database Indexes**
```sql
-- If player lookups are slow:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_players_auth_user_id 
ON players(auth_user_id);

-- If admin profile lookups are slow:
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_admin_profiles_user_id 
ON admin_profiles(user_id);
```

**Option 2: Cache Tenant Resolution**
Add in-memory cache for tenant lookups (30-60 second TTL)

**Option 3: Connection Pooling**
Use Prisma connection pooling if not already enabled
