## Expected Performance Improvements

### Before (From Your Screenshot):
- **59 requests, 96 seconds (1.6 minutes!)**
- `playerprofile` called **4 times** (1.11s, 1.51s, 1.35s each)
- `league-averages` called **2 times** (1.10s, 1.41s)
- `trends` called **2 times** (1.51s, 2.24s)
- `allmatches` called **2 times** (1.50s, 1.61s)

### After (Expected):
- **~50 requests, 3-5 seconds**
- `playerprofile` called **1 time** (deduplicated)
- `league-averages` called **1 time** (deduplicated)
- `trends` called **1 time** (deduplicated)
- `allmatches` called **1 time** (deduplicated)

### Performance Gains:
- **Request reduction:** 6-8 duplicates eliminated
- **Load time:** 96s → ~3-5s (**95% faster!**)
- **Subsequent loads:** Instant (from cache)

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Player Profile
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/player/profiles/29` (or any player ID)
- Or click on a player from Dashboard/Table

### 3. Check Network Tab
**Look for:**
- ✅ `playerprofile?id=29` - Called **1 time only**
- ✅ `league-averages` - Called **1 time only**
- ✅ `trends/29` - Called **1 time only**
- ✅ `allmatches` - Called **1 time only**
- ✅ Total requests: ~50 (down from 59)
- ✅ Load time: Under 5 seconds (down from 96s)

### 4. Test Caching
1. Navigate to player profile
2. Navigate away (to dashboard)
3. Navigate back to same player profile
4. **Expected:** Instant load (from cache, 0 API calls!)

### 5. Test Different Players
1. View Player A profile
2. View Player B profile
3. View Player A again
4. **Expected:** Player A loads instantly (cached), Player B fresh data

---

## What To Look For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Profile loads in under 5 seconds
- All 4 API endpoints called exactly 1 time each
- No duplicate requests
- Navigate away and back → instant load
- No errors in console

### ❌ If You See Problems:
- **Multiple calls to same endpoint** → React Query not working
- **Still slow (>10s)** → Check server console for slow queries
- **Errors** → Check console for stack trace, report back

---

## Console Logs You Should See

**In Browser:**
```
(none - no errors expected)
```

**In Server:**
```
🔍 [PROFILE] Fetching aggregated profile for player ID: 29
⏱️ [PROFILE] All parallel queries completed: XXXms
[TENANT_FILTER] ✅ Tenant filter applied: 00000000-...
```

## Test Now!

Restart your dev server and test the player profile page. It should be **dramatically** faster!

Report back:
1. Load time (from Network tab)
2. Number of requests
3. Are there duplicates?
4. Does caching work when you navigate away and back?

**Status:** Ready for testing! 🚀
